## Creating Builder Structures in Rustlang Part 2/3

### Let's build a Request Builder

We want to get a bit deeper into how we can build with patterns in
Rust. We want to work one step at a time. Without getting to
complex.

There are a few features that we plan to use on this module. The
`Cargo.toml` file will look like:

```rust
[package]
name = "builder_patterns"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
thiserror = "1"
```

We still have the `thiserror` being used. All of the old setup
files used in [Part
1](https://www.somescripting.com/posts/20230606135938) still apply here.
We will only be adding a new module `mod req_builder` to the `main.rs`.
This will connect our new file `req_builder.rs` to the compiler and
allow us to build. This will also allow the file to be found for
testing.

Let's jump into the `req_builder.rs` file and what the requirements
are.

* Have a basic method enum (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `Delete`)
* Allow those methods to implement Display and print the
  corresponding values
* Create an `HttpHeader` structure
* Create a `HttpRequest` structure
* Create a `HttpRequestBuilder` structure
* Implement the `HttpRequest::new()` and `HttpRequestBuilder`
  methods for each value.
* Add tests for everything

This is where we can start. As it grows we can add more, but I'd
rather get something down to start understanding the next steps.

Start with the header including everything that we will need. I would
like to have the ability to use `JSON` so we will include serde.

```rust
use crate::prelude::*;
use std::fmt;
use serde::Serialize;
use serde_json;
```

Let's build the `HttpMethod` enum:

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
pub enum HttpMethod {
    Get,
    Post,
    Put,
    Delete,
}
```

Let's implement Display for the `HttpMethod` enum:

```rust
impl fmt::Display for HttpMethod {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            HttpMethod::Get => write!(f, "GET"),
            HttpMethod::Post => write!(f, "POST"),
            HttpMethod::Put => write!(f, "PUT"),
            HttpMethod::Delete => write!(f, "DELETE"),
        }
    }
}
```

We will use an enum for the `HttpVersion`. Let's make that happen here.
Just going to go with the normal 2 Https versions for this one.

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
pub enum HttpVersion {
    Http1_1,
    Http2,
}

impl fmt::Display for HttpVersion {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> fmt::Result {
        match *self {
            HttpVersion::Http1_1 => write!(f, "HTTP/1.1"),
            HttpVersion::Http2 => write!(f, "HTTP/2"),
        }
    }
}
```

Now make the `HttpHeader` struct. In theory this could be
replaced with a tuple of Strings. We will make it's own struct. With
the ability to access the values publicly.

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Clone, Debug)]
pub struct HttpHeader {
    pub name: String,
    pub value: String,
}
```

We should start the `HttpRequest` struct here with all the basic
fields.

* method: `HttpMethod` enum
* url: String
* http_version: String
* headers: Vector of `HttpHeader` structs
* body: Option of String or None

```rust
#[derive(PartialEq, Debug)]
pub struct HttpRequest {
    method: HttpMethod,
    url: String,
    http_version: HttpVersion,
    headers: Vec<HttpHeader>,
    body: Option<String>,
}

```

For this pattern I don't want anyone to have to use the
`HttpRequestBuilder` but use a `.new()` setup on `HttpRequest`. We
could easily build this off of the `HttpRequestBuilder`. That just is not the path we will take.

```rust
impl HttpRequest {
		pub fn new() -> HttpRequestBuilder {
				HttpRequestBuilder::new()
		}
}
```

This won't compile because there is no `HttpRequestBuilder` and there is
not `new()` method to call. Let's think about what is happening here. We will create a new HttpRequestBuilder structure. Until we `build()` the request. Once the request is build. It will become a `HttpRequest` structure. Which won't allow you to build it anymore. Since the builder structure. Should be dropped after ownership change. I think...(We should dig deeper in the future. Theses are what the testing seems to show.

We should create the `HttpRequestBuilder` struct:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Default)]
pub struct HttpRequestBuilder {
		method: Option<HttpMethod>,
		url: Option<String>,
		http_version: Option<HttpVersion>,
		headers: Vec<HttpHeader>,
		body: Option<String>,
}
```

Let's compare the difference between the `HttpRequest` struct and the `HttpRequestBuilder` struct.

* Options around method, url, and http_version.

Nothing is really going to change. Except there will have more options. This will help with the build process. Where we might like to check. Some or None. Don't worry about it now. We could change it later. Or you may choose to do it a slightly style. That is also fine. This is just to give you different ideas. They can usually be tweaked a bit.

It would be a good time to start implementing the building pattern.

```rust
impl HttpRequestBuilder {
		pub fn new() -> Self {
				HttpRequestBuilder::default()
		}

		pub fn method(&mut self, method: HttpMethod) -> &mut Self {
				self.method = Some(method);
				self
		}
		pub fn url(&mut self, url: impl Into<String>) -> &mut Self {
				self.url = Some(url.into());
				self
		}
		pub fn http_version(&mut self, version: HttpVersion) -> &mut Self {
				self.http_version = Some(version);
				self
		}
		pub fn header(&mut self, header: HttpHeader) -> &mut Self {
				self.headers.push(header);
				self
		}
		pub fn body(&mut self, body: impl Serialize) -> &mut Self {
				let json = serde_json::to_string(&body).unwrap();
				self.body = Some(json);
				self
		}
}
```

There is a lot going on in the code block above. There are some specifics. I want to call out. The rest I will just leave it for your own study.

* `new` method using the `HttpRequestBuilder::default()` to create it's default. This is allowed because of the `#[derive(Default)]` above.
* `url` method using a `impl Into<String>` but we might want to use something that validates it is a URL before we use it.
* `header` method. Pushes the `HttpHeaders` into a vector. It does not replace, but adds only.
* `body` method requires `impl Serilalize` so we can take the json entered. Change it to a json string. While replacing the old body.

These are all taking in `&mut self` and passing out `&mut Self`. This will be more relevant. When we use the building pattern in testing.

```rust
pub fn build(mut self) -> Result<HttpRequest> {
		let method = self.method.take().ok_or(Error::Static("No METHOD"))?;
		let url = self.url.take().ok_or(Error::Static("No URL"))?;
		let http_version = self.http_version.take().ok_or(Error::Static("No HTTP VERSION"))?;

		Ok(HttpRequest {
				method,
				url,
				http_version,
				headers: self.headers,
				body: self.body.take(),
		})
}
```

### Now for the testing

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod request_builder {
    use super::*;

    #[derive(Serialize)]
    struct ExampleBody {
        name: String,
        age: u32,
    }

    #[test]
    fn setup_new_builder() {
        let req: HttpRequestBuilder = HttpRequest::new();
        assert_eq!(req.method, None);
        assert_eq!(req.url, None);
        assert_eq!(req.http_version, None);
        assert_eq!(req.headers.len(), 0);
        assert_eq!(req.body, None);
    }
    #[test]
    fn build_request() {
        let body = ExampleBody {
            name: "Justin".to_string(),
            age: 38,
        };

        let mut req: HttpRequestBuilder = HttpRequest::new();
        req.method(HttpMethod::Put)
            .url("https://google.com".to_string())
            .http_version(HttpVersion::Http1_1)
            .header(
                HttpHeader {
                    name: "cookie".to_string(),
                    value: "value".to_string()
                })
            .body(&body);
        let build = req.build().unwrap();

        assert_eq!(build.method, HttpMethod::Put);
        assert_eq!(build.url, "https://google.com".to_string());
        assert_eq!(build.http_version, HttpVersion::Http1_1);
        assert_eq!(build.headers.len(), 1);
        assert_eq!(
            build.body,
            Some(r#"{"name":"Justin","age":38}"#.to_string())
        );
    }
    #[test]
    fn build_with_no_method() {
        let mut req: HttpRequestBuilder = HttpRequest::new();
        req.url("https://google.com".to_string())
            .http_version(HttpVersion::Http1_1);

        let result = req.build();
        assert!(result.is_err());
        assert_eq!(result.unwrap_err().to_string(), "Static error: No METHOD");
    }
    #[test]
    fn build_with_no_url() {
        let mut req: HttpRequestBuilder = HttpRequest::new();
        req.method(HttpMethod::Put)
            .http_version(HttpVersion::Http1_1);

        let result = req.build();
        assert!(result.is_err());
        assert_eq!(result.unwrap_err().to_string(), "Static error: No URL");
    }
    #[test]
    fn build_with_no_http_version() {
        let mut req: HttpRequestBuilder = HttpRequest::new();
        req.method(HttpMethod::Put)
            .url("https://google.com".to_string());

        let result = req.build();
        assert!(result.is_err());
        assert_eq!(result.unwrap_err().to_string(), "Static error: No HTTP VERSION");
    }
}
```

In this specific example. You can't chain the whole method calls. This
seems to be because of the switch between the Builder and Request
structs. Borrowing/moving and dropping values. Once you `build()` the
request. It moves to the `HttpRequest` struct. Which locks any future
changes.

### Small bits at a time

Look around at this example. Test it out yourself. See if the tests
pass on your own machine. Maybe even make more tests. I'll be adding
more in section 3. I'll also be reading over this article and editing.
So it may change in the future. Please reach out if you notice
anything. Completely off.
