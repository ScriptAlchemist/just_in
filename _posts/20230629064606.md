### Reliable

Tokio's APIs are memory-safe, thread-safe, and misuse-resistant. This
helps prevent common bugs, such as unbounded queues, buffer overflows,
and task starvation.

### Fast

Building on top of Rust, Tokio provides a multi-threaded, work stealing
scheduler. Applications can process hundreds of thousands of requests
per second with minimal overhead.

### Easy

`async/await` reduces the complexity of writing asynchronous
applications. Paired with Tokio's utilities and vibrant ecosystem,
writing applications is a breeze.

### Flexible

The needs of a server application differ from that of an embedded
device. Although Tokio comes with defaults that work well out of the
box, it also provides the knobs needed to fine tune to different cases.

## Tutorial

Tokio is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. It
provides the building blocks needed for writing networking applications.
It gives the flexibility to target a wide rage of systems, from large
servers with dozens of cores to small embedded devices.

At a high level, Tokio provides a few major components:

* A multi-threaded runtime for executing asynchronous code.
* An asynchronous version of the standard library.
* A large ecosystem of libraries.

### Tokio's role in your project

When you write your application in an asynchronous manner, you enable it
to scale much better by reducing the cost of doing many things at the
same time. However, asynchronous Rust code does not run on its own, so
you must choose a runtime to execute it. The Tokio library is the most
widely used runtime, surpassing all other runtimes in usage combined.

Additionally, Tokio provides many useful utilities. When writing
asynchronous code, you cannot use the ordinary blocking APIs provided by
the Rust standard library, and must instead use asynchronous versions of
them. These alternate versions are provided by Tokio, mirroring the API
of the Rust standard library where it makes sense.

### Advantages of Tokio

This section will outline some advantages of Tokio.

#### Fast

Tokio is **fast**, built on top of the Rust programming language, which
itself is fast. This is done in the spirit of Rust with the goal that
you should not be able to improve the performance by writing equivalent
code by hand.

Tokio is **scalable**, built on top of the async/await language feature,
which itself is scalable. When dealing with networking, there's a limit
to how fast you can handle a connection due to latency, so the only way
to scale is to handle many connections at once. With the async/await
language feature, increasing the number of concurrent operations becomes
incredibly cheap, allowing you to scale to a large number of concurrent
tasks.

#### Reliable

Tokio is built using Rust, which is a language that empowers everyone to
build reliable and efficient software. A **number** of studies have
found that roughly ~70% of high severity security bugs are the result of
memory unsafety. Using Rust eliminates this entire class of bugs in your
applications.

Tokio also foces heavily on providing consistent behaviour with no
surprises. Tokio's major goal is to allow users to deploy predictable
software that will perform the same day in and day out with reliable
response times and no unpredictable latency spikes.

#### Easy

With Rust's async/await feature, the complexity of writing asynchronous
applications has been lowered substantially. Paired with Tokio's
utilities and vibrant ecosystem, writing applications is a breeze.

Tokio follows the standard library's naming convention when it makes
sense. This allows easily converting code written with only the standard
library to code written with Tokio. With the strong type system of Rust,
the ability to deliver correct code easily is unparalleled.

#### Flexible

Tokio provides multiple variations of the runtime. Everything from a
multi-threaded, **work-stealing** runtime to a light-weight,
single-threaded runtime. Each of these runtimes come with many knobs to
allow users to tune them to their needs.

### When no to use Tokio

Although Tokio is useful for many projects that need to do a lot of
thing simultaneously, there are also some use-cases where Tokio is not a
good fit.

* Speeding up CPU-bound computations by running them in parallel on
  several threads. Tokio is designed for IO-bound applications where each
  individual task spends most of its time waiting for IO. If the only
  thing your application does is run computations in parallel, you should
  be using [rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon/). That said, it is still
  possible to "mix & match" if you need to do both.
* Reading a lot of files. Although is seems like Tokio would be useful
  for projects that simply need to read a lot of files, Tokio provides
  no advantage here compared to an ordinary threadpool. This is because
  operating systems generally do not provide asynchronous file APIs.
* Sending a single web request. The place where Tokio gives you an
  advantage is when you need to do many things at the same time. If you
  need to use a library intended for asynchronous Rust such as
  [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/), but you don't need to do a lot of
  things at once, you should prefer the blocking version of that
  library, as it will make your project simpler. Using Tokio will still
  work, of course, but provides no real advantage over the blocking API.
  If the library doesn't provide a blocking API, see [the chapter on briding with sync code](https://tokio.rs/tokio/topics/bridging)

# Setup

We are going to go step by step through the Tokio tutorial. Building a
[Redis](https://redis.io/) client and server. We will start with the
basics of asynchronous programming with Rust and build up from there. We
will implement a subset of Redis commands but will get a comprehensive
tour of Tokio.

## Mini-Redis

The project that we will build is available at [Mini-Redis on
GitHub](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mini-redis). Mini-Redis is designed
with the primary goal of learning Tokio, and is therefore very well
commented, but this also means that Mini-Redis is missing some features
you would want in a real Redis library. You can find production-ready
Redis libraries on [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

We will use Mini-Redis directly in the tutorial. This allow us to use
parts of Mini-Redis in the tutorial before we implement them later in
the tutorial.

## Getting Help

At any point, if you get stuck, you can always get help on Discord or
Github discussions. Don't worry about asking beginner questions. We all
start somewhere and are happy to help.

## Prerequisites

Readers should already be familiar with `Rust`. The [Rust
book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is a great reference.

While not required, some experience with writing networking code using
the [Rust standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/) or another
language can be helpful.

No pre-existing knowledge of Redis is required.

### Rust

Before getting started, you should make sure that you have the Rust
toolchain. This is past the scope for this article. You should be able
to create and run Rust🦀 projects. If you don't go figure it out
please.

### Mini-Redis Server

Next, install the Mini-Redis server. This will be used to test out
client as we build it.

```bash
❯ cargo install mini-redis
```

Make sure that it was successfully installed by starting the server:

```bash
❯ mini-redis-server
```

Then, in a separate terminal window, try to get the key foo using
`mini-redis-cli`

```bash
❯ mini-redis-cli get foo
```

You have see `(nil)`

## Ready to go

That's it, everything is ready to go. Go to the next page to write your
first asynchronous Rust application.

---

# Hello Tokio

We will get started by writing a very basic Tokio application. It will
connect to the Mini-Redis server, set the value of the key `hello` to
`world`. It will then read back the key. This will be done using the
Mini-Redis client library.

## The code

* Generate a new crate

```bash
❯ cargo new my-redis
```

* Move into project folder

```bash
❯ cd my-redis
```

* Add dependencies

`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
mini-redis = "0.4"
```

* Write the code

Then, open up `main.rs` and replace the contents of the file with:

```rust
use mini_redis::{client, Result};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
  // Open a connection on the mini-redis address.
  let mut client = client::connect("127.0.0.1:6379").await?;

  // Set the key "hello" with value "world"
  client.set("hello", "world".into()).await?;

  // Get key "hello"
  let result = client.get("hello").await?;

  println!("got value from the server; result={:?}", result);

  Ok(())
}
```

Make sure the Mini-Redis server is running. In a separate terminal
window, run:

```bash
❯ mini-redis-server
```

If you have not already installed mini-redis, you can do so with:

```bash
❯ cargo install mini-redis
```

Now, run the `my-redis` application:

```bash
❯ cargo run

got value from the server; result=Some(b"world")
```

Success!

You can find the full code [here](https://github.com/tokio-rs/website/blob/master/tutorial-code/hello-tokio/src/main.rs)

---

## Breaking it down

Let's take some time to go over what we did. There isn't much code, but
a lot is happening.

```rust
let mut client = client::connect("127.0.0.1:6379").await?;
```

The `client::connect` function is provided by the `mini-redis` crate. It
asynchronously establishes a TCP connection with the specified remote
address. Once the connection is established, a **client** handle is
returned. Even though the operation is performed asynchronously, the
code we write **looks** synchronous. The only indication that the
operation is asynchronous is the `.await` operator.

### What is asynchronous programming?

Most computer programs are executed in the same order in which they are
written. The first line executes, then the next, and so on. With
synchronous programming, when a program encounters an operation that
cannot be completed immediately, it will block until the operation
completes. For example, establishing a TCP connection requires an
exchange with a peer over the network, which can take a sizeable amount
of time. During this time, the thread is blocked.

With asynchronous programming, operations that cannot complete
immediately are suspended to the background. The thread is not blocked,
and can continue running other things. Once the operation complete, the
task is unsuspended and continues processing from where it left off. Our
example from before only has one task, so nothing happens while it is
suspended, but asynchronous programs typically have many such tasks.

Although asynchronous programming can result in faster applications, if
often results in much more complicated programs. The programmer is
required to track all the state necessary to resume work once the
asynchronous operation completes. Historically, this is a tedious and
error-prone task.

### Compile-time green-threading

Rust implements asynchronous programming using a feature called
`async/await`. Functions that perform asynchronous operations are
labeled with the `async` keyword. In our example, the `connect`
function is defined like this:

```rust
use mini_redis::Result;
use mini_redis::client::Client;
use tokio::new::ToSockerAddrs;

pub async fn connect<T: ToSocketAddrs>(addr: T) -> Result<Client> {
  // ...
}
```

The `async fn` definition looks like a regular synchronous function, but
operates asynchronously. Rust transforms the `async fn` at **compile**
time into a routine that operates asynchronously. Any calls to `.await`
within the `async fn` yield control back to the thread. The thread may
do other work while the operation process in the background.

> Although other languages implement `async/await` too, Rust takes a
unique approach. Primarily, Rust's async operations are **lazy**. This
results in different runtime semantics than other languages.

If this doesn't quite make sense yet, don't worry. We will explore
`async/await` more throughout the guide.

### using `async/await`

Async functions are called like nay other Rust function. However,
calling these functions does not result in the function body executing.
Instead, calling an `async fn` returns a value representing the
operation. This is conceptually analogous to a zero-argument closure. To
actually run the operation, you should use it `.await` operator on the
return value.

For example, the given program

```rust
async fn say_world() {
  println!("world");
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  // Calling `say_world()` does not execute the body of `say_world()`.
  let op = say_world();

  // This println! comes first
  println!("hello");

  // Calling `.await` on `op` starts executing `say_world`.
  op.await;
}
```

Outputs:

```bash
❯ hello
❯ world
```

The return value of an `async fn` is an anonymous type that implements
the `Future` trait.


### Async `main` function

The main function used to launch the application differs from the usual
one found in most of Rust's crates.

1. It is an `aync fn`
2. It is annotated with `#[tokio::main]`

An `async fn` is used as we want to enter an asynchronous context.
However, asynchronous functions must be executed by a
[runtime](https://docs.rs/tokio/1/tokio/runtime/index.html). The runtime
contains the asynchronous task scheduler, provides evented I/O, timers,
etc. The runtime does not automatically start, so the main function
needs to start it.

The `#[tokio::main]` function is a macro. It transforms the `async fn
main()` into a synchronous `fn main()` that initializes a runtime
instance and executes the async main function.

For example:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  println!("hello");
}
```

gets transformed into:

```rust
fn main() {
  let mut rt = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap();
  rt.block_on(async {
    println!("hello");
  })
}
```

The details of the Tokio runtime will be covered later.

### Cargo features


When depending on Tokio for this tutorial, the `full` feature flag is
enabled `tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }`.

Tokio has a lot of functionality (TCP, UDP, Unix sockets, timers, sync
utilities, multiple scheduler types, etc). Not all applications need all
functionality. When attempting to optimize compile timer or the end
application footprint, the application can decide to opt into **only**
the features it uses.

---

## Spawning

We are going to shift gears and start working on the Redis server.

First, move the client `SET`/`GET` code from the previous section to an
example file. This way, we can run it against our server.

```bash
❯ mkdir -p examples
❯ mv src/main.rs examples/hello-redis.rs
```

Then create a new, empty `src/main.rs` and continue.

## Accepting sockets

The first thing our Redis server needs to do is to accept inbound TCP
sockets. This is done by binding `tokio::net::TcpListener` to port
**6379**.

> Many of Tokio'S types are named the same as their synchronous
equivalent in the Rust standard library. When it makes sense, Tokio
exposes the same APIs as **std** but using `async fn`.

Then the sockets are accepted in a loop. Each socket is processed then
closed. For now, we will read the command, print it to stdout and
respond with an error.

```rust
use tokio::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};
use mini_redis::{Connection, Frame

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  // Bind the listener to the address
  let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:6379").await.unwrap();

  loop {
    // The second item contains the IP and port of the new connection.
    let (socket, _) = listener.accept().await().unwrap();
    process(socket).await;
  }
}

async fn process(socket: TcpStream) {
  // The `Connection` lets us read/write redis **frames** instead of
  // byte streams. The `Connection` type is defined by mini-redis.
  let mut connection = Connection::new(socket);

  if let Some(frame) = connection.read_frame().await.unwrap() {
    println!("GOT: {:?}", frame);

    // Respond with error
    let response = Frame::Error("unimplemented".to_string());
    connection.write_frame(&response).await.unwrap();
  }
}
```

Now run this accept loop:

```bash
❯ cargo run
```

In a separate terminal window, run the `hello-redis` example (the
`SET`/`GET` command from the previous section):

```bash
❯ cargo run --example hello-redis
```

the output should be:

```bash
Error: "unimplemented"
```

In the server terminal, the output is:

```bash
GOT: Array([Bulk(b"set"), Bulk(b"hello"), Bulk(b"world")])
```

## Concurrency

Our server has a slight problem (besides only responding with errors).
It processes inbound requests on at a time. When a connection is
accepted, the server stays inside the accept loop block until the
response is fully written to the socket.

We want our Redis server to process **many** concurrent request. To do
this, we need to add some concurrency.

> Concurrency and parallelism are not the same thing. If you alternate
between two tasks, then you are working on both tasks concurrently, but
not in parallel. For it to qualify as parallel, you would need two
people, on dedicated to each task.
>
> One of the advantages of using Tokio is that asynchronous code allows
you to work on many tasks concurrently, without having to work on them in
parallel using ordinary threads. In fact, Tokio can run many tasks
concurrently on a single thread!

To process connections concurrently, a new task is spawned for each
inbound connection. The connection is processed on this task.

The accept loop becomes:

```rust
use tokio::new::TcpListener;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:6379").await.unwrap();

  loop {
    let (socket, _) = listener.accept().await.unwrap();
    // A new task is spawned for each inbound socket. The socket is
    // moved to the new teask and processed there.
    tokio::spawn(async move {
      process(socket).await;
    });
  }
}
```

### Tasks

A Tokio task is an asynchronous green thread. They are created by
passing an `async` block to `tokio::spawn`. The `tokio::spawn` function
returns a `JoinHandle`, which the caller may use to interact with the
spawned task. The `async` block may have a return value. The caller may
obtain the return value using `.await` on the `JoinHandle`.

For example:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let handle = tokio::spawn(async {
    // Do some async work
    "return value"
  });

  // Do some work

  let out = handle.await.unwrap();
  println!("GOT {}", out);
}
```

Awaiting on `JoinHandle` returns a `Result`. When a task encounters an
error during execution, the `JoinHandle` will return an `Err`. This
happens when the task either panics, or if the task is forcefully
cancelled by the runtime shutting down.

Tasks are the unit of execution managed by the scheduler. Spawning the
task submits it to the Tokio scheduler, which then ensures that the task
executes when it has work to do. The spawned task may be executed on the
same thread as where it was spawned, or it may execute on a different
runtime thread. The task can also be moved between threads after being
spawned.

Tasks in Tokio are very lightweight. Under the hood, they require only a
single allocation and 64 bytes of memory. Applications should feel free
to spawn thousands, if not millions of tasks.

### 'static bound

When you spawn a task on the Tokio runtime, its type's lifetime must be
`'static`. This means that the spawned task much not contain any
references to data owned outside the task.

> Is it a common misconception that `'static` always means "lives
forever", but this is not the case. Just because a value is `'static`
does not mean that you have a memory leak. You can read more in [Common
Rust Lifetime
Misconceptions](https://github.com/pretzelhammer/rust-blog/blob/master/posts/common-rust-lifetime-misconceptions.md#2-if-t-static-then-t-must-be-valid-for-the-entire-program).

For example, the following will not compile:

```rust
use tokio::task;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

  task::spawn(async {
    println!("Here's a vec: {:?}", v);
  });
}
```

Attempting to compile this results in the following error:

```bash
error[E0373]: async block may outlive the current function, but
              it borrows `v`, which is owned by the current function
 --> src/main.rs:7:23
  |

  | |                                        - `v` is borrowed here
9 | |     });
  | |_____^ may outlive borrowed value `v`
  |
note: function requires argument type to outlive `'static`
 --> src/main.rs:7:17
  |
7 |       task::spawn(async {
  |  _________________^
8 | |         println!("Here's a vector: {:?}", v);
9 | |     });
  | |_____^
help: to force the async block to take ownership of `v` (and any other
      referenced variables), use the `move` keyword
  |
7 |     task::spawn(async move {
8 |         println!("Here's a vec: {:?}", v);
9 |     });
  |
```

This happens because by default, variables are not **moved** into async
blocks. The `v` vector remains owned by the `main` function. The
`println!` line borrows `v`. The rust compiler helpfully explains this
to use and even suggests the fix! Changing line 7 to `task::spawn(async
move {` will instruct the compiler to **move** `v` into the spawned
task. Now, the task owns all of its data, making it `'static`.

If a single piece of data must be accessible from more than one task
concurrently, then it must be shared using synchronization primitives
such as `Arc`.

Note that the error message talks about the argument type `outliving`
the `'static` lifetime. This terminology can be rather confusing because
the `'static` lifetime lasts until the end of the program, so if it
outlives it, don't you have a memory leak? The explanation is that it is
the **type**, not the **value** that must outlive the `'static`
lifetime, and the value may be destroyed before its type is no longer
valid.

When we say that a value is `'staic`, all that means is that it would
not be incorrect to keep that value around forever. This is important
because the compiler is unable to reason about how long a newly spawned
task stays around. We have to make sure that the task is allowed to live
forever, so that Tokio can make the task run as long as it needs to.

The article that the info-box earlier links to uses the terminology
"bounded by `'static`" rather than "its type outlives `'static`" or "the
value is `'static`" to refer to `T: 'static`. These all mean the same
thing, but are different from "annotated with `'static`" as in `&'static
T`.

### **Send** bound

Tasks spawned by `Tokio::spawn` **must** implement `Send`. This allows
the Tokio runtime to move the tasks between threads while they are
suspended at an `.await`.

Tasks are `Send` when **all** data that is held **across** `.await`
calls is `Send`. This is a bit subtle. When `.await` is called, the task
yields back to the scheduler. The next time the task is executed, it
resumes from the point it last yielded. To make this work, all state
that is used **after** `.await` must be saved by the task. If this state
is `Send`, i.e. can be moved across threads, then the task itself can be
moved across threads. Conversely, if the state is not `Send`, then
neither is the task.

For example, this works:

```rust
use tokio::task::yield_now;
use std::rc::Rc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  tokio::spawn(async {
    // The scope forces 'rc' to drop before '.await'.
    {
      let rc = Rc::new("hello");
      println!("{}", rc);
    }

    // 'rc' is no longer used. It is **not** persisted when
    // the task yields to the scheduler
    yield_now().await;
  });
}
```

This does not:

```rust
use tokio::task::yield_now;
use std::rc::Rc;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  tokio::spawn(async {
    let rc = Rc::new("hello");

    // 'rc' is used after '.await'. It must be persisted to
    // the task's state.
    yield_now().await;

    println!("{}", rc);
  });
}
```

Attempting to compile the snippet results in:

```bash
error: future cannot be sent between threads safely
   --> src/main.rs:6:5
    |

```

We will discuss a special case of this error in more depth in the next
chapter.

## Store values

We will now implement the **process** function to handle incoming
commands. We will use a `HashMap` to store values. **SET** commands
will insert into the `HashMap` and **GET** values will load them.
Additionally, we will use a loop to accept more than one command per
connection.

```rust
use tokio::new::TcpStream;
use mini_redis::{Connection, Frame};

async fn process(socket: TcpStream) {
  use mini_redis::Command::{self, Get, Set};
  use std::collections::HashMap;

  // A hashmap is used to store data
  let mut db = HashMap::new();

  // Connection, provided by 'mini-redis', handles parsing frames from
  // the socket
  let mut connection = Connection::new(socket);

  // User 'read_frame" to receive a command from the connection.
  while let Some(frame) = connection.read_frame().await.unwrap() {
    let response = match Command::from_frame(frame).unwrap() {
      Set(cmd) => {
```
