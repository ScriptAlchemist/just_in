### Reliable

Tokio's APIs are memory-safe, thread-safe, and misuse-resistant. This
helps prevent common bugs, such as unbounded queues, buffer overflows,
and task starvation.

### Fast

Building on top of Rust, Tokio provides a multi-threaded, work stealing
scheduler. Applications can process hundreds of thousands of requests
per second with minimal overhead.

### Easy

`async/await` reduces the complexity of writing asynchronous
applications. Paired with Tokio's utilities and vibrant ecosystem,
writing applications is a breeze.

### Flexible

The needs of a server application differ from that of an embedded
device. Although Tokio comes with defaults that work well out of the
box, it also provides the knobs needed to fine tune to different cases.

## The Stack

* ![Tokio Logo](/assets/blog/img_bin/tokio-horizontal.svg)

Applications aren't built in a vacuum. The Tokio stack includes
everything needed to ship to production, fast.

## Runtime

* ![Runtime Logo](/assets/blog/img_bin/runtime.svg)

Including I/O, timer, file-system synchronization, and scheduling
facilities, the Tokio runtime is the foundation of asynchronous
applications.

## Tutorial

Tokio is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. It
provides the building blocks needed for writing networking applications.
It gives the flexibility to target a wide rage of systems, from large
servers with dozens of cores to small embedded devices.
