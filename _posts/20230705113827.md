## Simple Rust Coding Layout

I take notes while I learn. I'll give credit to [Jeremy
Chone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxx7MmN4Ib0) on youtube for the
video. It's mostly going to be a walk through of what's happening
in the video. With a little extra, here and there.

Let's start in the `Cargo.toml` file and make sure we have our
dependencies.

```bash
cargo new simple_code_layout
    Created binary (application) `simple_code_layout` package
```

Output:

```bash
    Created binary (application) `simple_code_layout` package
```

```bash
cd simple_code_layout
vim Cargo.toml
```

Our generated `Cargo.toml` should look something like this.:

```toml
[package]
name = "simple_code_layout"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
```

We will add a few dependencies to the project

* error handling helper
* async helper


```toml
[package]
name = "simple_code_layout"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
thiserror = "1" // error helper
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] } // async helper

[dev-dependencies]
anyhow = "1" // error helper
```

---

We can go into main and mute some of the warnings:

```rust
#![allow(unused)]

fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

After this we will make our first module `error.rs`. While placing `mod error;` at the top of the `main.rs`.

```rust
#![allow(unused)]

mod error;

fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

This will require us to make another file called `error.rs`. So we can move over to that location. We will start with a basic error setup. With a generic and an option for an IO operation.

```rust
//! Main Crate Error

#[derive(thiserror::Error, Debug)]
pub enum Error {
    #[error("Generic {0}")]
    Generic(String),
    #[error(transparent)]
    IO(#[from] std::io::Error),
}
```

Next we will create the `prelude.rs` file and allow the project to find the package in the `main.rs` using `mod prelude;`.

```rust
//! Crate prelude

pub use crate::error::Error;

pub type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>;
```

Inside of the prelude we are going to bring in the Error crate and create a public Result type. That uses the Result from the core library and the Error from our `error.rs`.

We will also include a wrapper for the newtype pattern.

```rust
pub struct W<T>(pub T);
```

The personal preference of Jeremy is also to add format as f.

```rust
pub use std::format as f;
```

First we will go back to the main and clean it up a bit. Our new main looks like this:

```rust
#![allow(unused)]

mod error;
mod prelude;
mod utils;

use crate::prelude::*;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    Ok(())
}
```

We are going to import `std::fs::read_dir` into the `main.rs` and run:

```rust
for entry in read_dir("./")?.filter_map(|e| e.ok()) {
  println!("{entry:?}");
}
```

So the new `main.rs` looks like:

```rust
#![allow(unused)]

mod error;
mod prelude;
mod utils;

use crate::prelude::*;
use std::fs::read_dir;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    println!("Simple Code Layout");

    for entry in read_dir("./")?.filter_map(|e| e.ok()) {
        println!("{entry:?}");
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

The output to the terminal when we run `cargo run` is:

```bash
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.67s
 Running `target/debug/simple_code_layout`
 Simple Code Layout
 DirEntry("./Cargo.lock")
 DirEntry("./Cargo.toml")
 DirEntry("./src")
 DirEntry("./target")
 [Finished running. Exit status: 0]
```

But there is a lot going on in this small snippet that we should go though for that sake of rust.

```rust
for entry in read_dir("./")?.filter_map(|e| e.ok()) {
  println!("{entry:?}");
}
```

* loop over the `dir` `./`.
* Using `?` allow the `read_dir` to return a result or an error.
* Running though `filter_map` and only accepting the values that return `Ok`.
* Print the `entry` using debug.

If we want to store the value in a `String` instead of just print it. We have to add a bit more fanciness to the code.

```
for entry in read_dir("./")?.filter_map(|e| e.ok()) {
  let entry: Result<String, Error> = entry: DirEntry
	    .path(): PathBuf
			.to_str(): Option<&str>
			.map(String::from): Option<String>
			.ok_or_else(err: || {
			    Error::Generic(f!("Invalid path {entry:?}"))
			})?;
  println!("{entry:?}");
}
```

This code above might not copy and paste easily. I have added the type path through the function as well.

The output now becomes:

```rust
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.63s
     Running `target/debug/simple_code_layout`
Simple Code Layout
"./Cargo.lock"
"./Cargo.toml"
"./src"
"./target"
[Finished running. Exit status: 0]
```

* Create the `direntry_froms.rs` file in the utils directory. Moving the directory name function into an external file.

```rust
use crate::prelude::*;
use std::fs::DirEntry;

impl TryFrom<W<&DirEntry>> for String {
    type Error = Error;
    fn try_from(val: W<&DirEntry>) -> Result<String> {
        val.0.path()
            .to_str()
            .map(String::from)
            .ok_or_else(|| {
                Error::Generic(f!(
                    "Invalid path {:?}",
                    val.0
                ))
            })
    }
}
```

Don't forget to `mod direntry_froms;`

Now we can add back to the `main.rs`:

```rust
#![allow(unused)]

mod error;
mod prelude;
mod utils;

use crate::prelude::*;
use std::fs::read_dir;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    println!("Simple Code Layout");

    for entry in read_dir("./")?.filter_map(|e| e.ok()) {
        let entry: String = W(&entry).try_into()?;
        println!("{entry:?}");
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

Where the only line we really add here is `let entry: String = W(&entry).try_into()?;`.
