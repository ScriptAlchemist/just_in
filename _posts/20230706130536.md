title: 'Mobile View with scrolling features as a demo challenge'
excerpt: 'While building a demo there have been many problems that have
come up. Not so much with data movement. Just on the design with mobile
designs. The mobile view is the most tempermental piece of development.
We are going to talk about some of the problems that we are solving
here.'

# Mobile View with scrolling features as a demo challenge

> ðŸ›‘ This might make little sense. Part of it is notes while working
on a problem. While also trying to convey certain thought process. I
might have some of the information wrong. I might have some of the
thoughts skipped. If you have any questions. You'll have to ask me on my
socials.

What are the problems that we want to solve with this mobile view
option? Well while we build this application we are attempting to get a
user experience along with the ease of use. My biggest struggle is I'm
not 100% sure of the best designs on mobile screens. Which ends in a
whole lot of experimentation. With this write up we will attempt to
break it down into a cleaner and more understandable design.

---

## Let's look at the old demo now.

* What functions are we bringing over of each one?
* What are the goals and how to stay in them?
* How can we make sure the demo is exactly what we would like for on
  zoom?
* How can we get the demo to work on mobile, where necessary?

The full demo has two sides. One side that relies on a user experience
and the other side that ends up being more of the employee side of the
project. We will dive deeper into each of these blocks a bit lower. Just
to show everything being contained in the demo project.

If you need access to the file. You can always contact me. To obtain a
higher quality picture.

This old design is the first task that we are attempting to complete for
a cleaner and nicer user experience. Some examples that were found are
in the image below these line. It's less colorful and more streamlined
into a newer, rounder, and cleaner design.

* Calm colors.
* Clean and rounded design.
* Light color backgrounds and button colors.
* Avoiding useless distractions
* User design focused on the user side.
* Employee section is second to the use of the user section.
* Employee section is easy
* User mobile/desktop design with scroll panels is hard and buggy.

### User Side (Old Demo)

On the user side. We have two different displays right away. We should
go a little bit deeper into what's happening on each side. Then we will
go deeper into. The mobile vs. desktop view is arbitrary. In these
images it's just looking to convey the movement of the application.

Both sides are going to be a collection of data that is displayed to the
user.

* Track payments to items
* Track Items to payments

![Set Once User Side Old Demo Example](/assets/blog/post_bin/set_once_demo/set_once_demo_old_userside_style.png)

If we zoom in on the left side first. We see the more mobile design.
Where is has a list of items for the list. There will be payment items that can
be clicked on that list. Which will bring the user to the next level.
Which allows the user to understand more about that specific payment. We
can call this first page the `/user/payments`

On this second page we want all the payments that are connected. Along
with the calculation panel.

> ðŸ’¡ In the demo this calculation panel slides in from the right side. This
> is something that we have experimented with for a few iterations and it
> was too buggy to keep. The problem that we are running into with this.
> When the user presses their finger it can be on the sliding panel on the
> Y axis. When we want it to be the X axis. This bug is a pain and time
> spend attempting to fix it. Made the process not worth it for this demo.

> ðŸ›‘ The solution is going to be a layered panels. That you will have to
> scroll up and down on. After they layers panels. There can be the option
> of adding a button that will allow the panel to slide in from the side.
> Honestly this is something that is caught between time and money. The
> perfect setup can possibly be accomplished, but in a 2 week timeframe.
> Wasting days is not the way we want to do this.

One more note on this 2nd information page at `/user/payment-detail`.
The details on this page will be able to dig even deeper into the data.
To see the connected documents. You can notice if you click `Struct.
Repair Estimate` it opens up the popup panel with data connected to the
image. In the demo this only works on a few example. This is something
that is crucial to give a good demo of the product that we are planning
to use.

Here is the thing. The user desktop side is going to be exactly like the
search by payment side. The only difference in this demo is the fact
that we are now. Searching by items. This layout isn't exactly what we
want. There is a level of smushing happening. Where we want to show that
there is a layer below. That we can click back to. This might be
something that we want on a desktop. Not to the side, but somewhere more
in the middle.
