title: 'Mobile View with scrolling features as a demo challenge'
excerpt: 'While building a demo there have been many problems that have
come up. Not so much with data movement. Just on the design with mobile
designs. The mobile view is the most tempermental piece of development.
We are going to talk about some of the problems that we are solving
here.'

# Mobile View with scrolling features as a demo challenge

> ðŸ›‘ This might make little sense. Part of it is notes while working
on a problem. While also trying to convey certain thought process. I
might have some of the information wrong. I might have some of the
thoughts skipped. If you have any questions. You'll have to ask me on my
socials.

What are the problems that we want to solve with this mobile view
option? Well while we build this application we are attempting to get a
user experience along with the ease of use. My biggest struggle is I'm
not 100% sure of the best designs on mobile screens. Which ends in a
whole lot of experimentation. With this write up we will attempt to
break it down into a cleaner and more understandable design.

## Let's look at the old demo now.

* What functions are we bringing over of each one?
* What are the goals and how to stay in them?
* How can we make sure the demo is exactly what we would like for on
  zoom?
* How can we get the demo to work on mobile, where necessary?

The full demo has two sides. One side that relies on a user experience
and the other side that ends up being more of the employee side of the
project. We will dive deeper into each of these blocks a bit lower. Just
to show everything being contained in the demo project.

If you need access to the file. You can always contact me. To obtain a
higher quality picture.

This old design is the first task that we are attempting to complete for
a cleaner and nicer user experience. Some examples that were found are
in the image below these line. It's less colorful and more streamlined
into a newer, rounder, and cleaner design.

* Calm colors.
* Clean and rounded design.
* Light color backgrounds and button colors.
* Avoiding useless distractions
* User design focused on the user side.
* Employee section is second to the use of the user section.
* Employee section is easy
* User mobile/desktop design with scroll panels is hard and buggy.

### User Side (Old Demo)

On the user side. We have two different displays right away. We should
go a little bit deeper into what's happening on each side. Then we will
go deeper into. The mobile vs. desktop view is arbitrary. In these
images it's just looking to convey the movement of the application.
