# The Axum Announcement

Today we are happy to announce `axum`: An easy to use, yet powerful, web
framework designed to take full advantage of the Tokio ecosystem.

## High Level Features

* Route request to handlers with a macro free API.
* Declaratively parse requests using extractors.
* Simple and predictable error handling model.
* Generate responses with minimal boilerplate.
* Take full advantage of the **tower** and `tower-http` ecosystem of
  middleware, services, and utilities.


In particular the last point is what sets `axum` apart from existing
frameworks. `axum` doesn't have its own middleware system but instead
uses `tower::Service`. This means `axum` gets timeouts, tracing,
compression, authorization, and more, for free. It also enables you to
share middleware with applications written using `hyper` or `tonic`.

### Usage Examples

The "hello world" of `axum` look like this:

```rust
use axum::prelude::*;
use std::net::SocketAddr;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  let app = route("/", get(root));

  let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], 3000));
  hyper::Server::bind(&addr)
    .server(app.into_make_service())
    .await
    .unwrap();
}

async fn root() -> &'static str {
  "Hello, World!"
}
```

This will response to `Get /` with a `200 OK` response where the body is
`Hello, World!`. Any other request will result in a `404 Not Found`
response.

#### Extractors

Requests can be parsed declaratively using "extractors". An extractor
is a type the implements `FromRequest`. Extractors can be used as
arguments to handlers and will run uif the request URI matches.

For example, `Json` is an extractor that consumes the request body and
parses it as JSON:

```rust
use axum::{prelude::*, extract::Json};
use serde::Deserialize;

#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct CreateUser {
  username: String,
}

async fn create_user(Json(payload): Json<CreateUser>) {
  // 'payload' is a 'CreateUser'
}

let app = route("/users", post(create_user));
```

`axum` ships with many useful extractors such as:

* `Bytes`, `String`, `Body`, and `BodyStream` for consuming the
  request body.
* `Method`, `HeaderMap`, and `Uri` for getting specific parts of the
  request.
* `Form`, `Query`, `UrlParams`, and `UrlParamsMap` for more high level
  request parsing.
* `[Extension]` for sharing state across handlers.
* `Request<hyper::Body>` if you want full control.
* `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>` to make an extractor optional.

You can also define you own by implementing `FromRequest`

#### Building responses

Handlers can return anything that implements `IntoResponse` and it will
automatically be converted  into a response:

```rust
use http::StatusCode;
use axum::response::{Html, Json};
use serde_json::{json, Value};

// We've already seen returning &'static str {
async fn text() -> &'static str {
  "Hello, World!"
}

// String works too
async fn string() -> String {
  "Hello, World!".to_string()
}

// Returning a tuple of `StatusCode` and another `IntoResponse` will
// change the status code
async fn not_found() -> (StatusCode, &'static str) {
  (StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "not found")
}

// `Html` gives a content-type of `text/html`
async fn html() -> Html<&'static str> {
  Html("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>")
}

// `Json` give a content-type of `application/json` and work with any t
// that implements `serde::Serialize`
async fn json() -> Json<Value> {
  Json(json!({ "data": 42 }))
}
```

This means in practice you rarely have to build your own `Responses`.
You can also implement `IntoResponse` to create you own domain specific
responses.

#### Routing

Multiple routes can be combined using a simple DSL:

```rust
use axum::prelude::*;

let app = route("/", get(root))
  .route("/users", get(list_users).post(create_user))
  .route("/users/:id", get(show_user).delete(delete_user));
```

#### Middleware

`axum` supports middleware from `tower` and `tower-http`:

```rust
use axum::prelude::*;
use tower_http::{compression::CompressionLayer, trace::TraceLayer};
use tower::ServiceBuilder;
use std::time::Duration;


let middleware_stack = ServiceBuilder::new()
  // timeout all requests after 10 seconds
  .timeout(Duration::from_secs(10))
  // add high level tracing of requests and responses
  .layer(TraceLayer::new_for_http())
  // compression responses
  .layer(CompressionLayer::new())
  // convert the `ServiceBuilder` into a `tower::Layer`
  .into_inner();

let app = route("/", get(|| async { "Hello, World!" }))
  // wrap our application in the middleware stack
  .layer(middleware_stack);
```

This feature is key as it allows us to write middleware once and share
them across applications. For example, `axum` doesn't have to provide
its own tracing/logging middleware, `TraceLayer` from `tower-http` can
be used directly. The same middleware can also be used for clients or
servers made with `Tonic`.

#### Routing to any `tower::Service`

`axum` can also route requests to any `tower` leaf service. Could be you
write using `service_fn` or something from another crate, such as
`ServeFile` from `tower-http`:

```rust
use axum::{service, prelude::*};
use http::Response;
use std::convert::Infallible;
use tower::{service_fn, BoxError};
use tower_http::services::ServeFile;

let app = route(
  // Any request to `/` goes to a some `Service`
  "/",
  service::any(service_fn(|_: Request<Body>| async {
    let res = Response::new(Body::from("Hi from `Get /`"));
    Ok::<_, Infallible>(res)
  }))
).route(
  // GET `/static/Cargo.toml` goes to a service from tower-http
  "/static/Cargo.toml",
  service::get(ServeFile::new("Cargo.toml"))
);
```

### Learn More

This is just a small sample of what `axum` provides. Error handling, web
sockets, and parsing `multipart/form-data` requests are some features
not shown here. See the [docs](https://docs.rs/axum) for more details.

You can also check the [examples in the
repo](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/master/examples) to see some
slightly larger applications written with `axum`.

As always, if you have questions you can go to the Tokio discord and ask
those questions.

## Personal Thoughts about Axum

Well it seems to be a very clean design. Some of the amazing features
comes from the compatibility between `Tokio` tooling. It's not just to
make API. It's just one step in the process to get a fully working Rust
server and access point.

I'm a huge fan of Tokio and I want to learn more about `Axum`. I believe
this is the way that I plan to use the async setup in `RustðŸ¦€`.

## What is Axum again?

A web application framework that focuses on ergonomics and modularity.

### High-level features

* Route requests to handler with macro-free API.
* Declarative parse requests using extractors.
* Simple and predictable error handling model
* Generate responses with minimal boilerplate.
* Take full advantage of the `tower` and `tower-http` ecosystem of
  middleware, services, and utilities.

In particular, the last point is what sets `axum` apart from other
frameworks. There is not middleware system but instead it uses
`tower::Service`. This means `axum` gets timeouts, tracing, compression,
authorization, and more, for free. It also enables you to share
middleware with applications written using `hyper` or `tonic`.

> ðŸ’¬ These are some repeated comments, but we really like this
framework. So we just want to make sure we remember everything that we
are reading about.

### Compatibility

Axum is designed to work with `tokio` and `hyper`. Runtime and transport
layer independence is not a goal, at least for the time being.

### Example

A "Hello, World!" or axum is:

```rust
use axum::{
  routing::get,
  Router,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  // build our application with a single route
  let app = Router::new().route("/", get(|| async { "Hello, World!" }));

  // run it with hyper on localhost:3000
  axum::Server::bind(&"0.0.0.0:3000".parse().unwrap())
    .serve(app.into_make_service())
    .await
    .unwrap();
}
```

Not using `#[tokio::main]` requires you enable tokio's `macros` and
`rt-multi-thread` features or just `full` to enable all features
(`cargo add tokio --features macros,rt-multi-thread`).

### Routing

`Router` is used to setup which paths goes to which services:

```rust
use axum::{Router, routing::get};

// our router
let app = Router::new()
  .route("/", get(root))
  .route("/foo", get(get_foo).post(post_foo))
  .route("/foo/bar", get(foo_bar));

// which calls one of these handlers
async fn root() {}
async fn get_foo() {}
async fn post_foo() {}
async fn foo_bar() {}
```

You can checkout the
[Router](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/struct.Router.html) for more
details on routing.

### Handlers

In axum a "handler" is an async function that accepts zero or more
`extractors` as arguments and returns something that can be converted
`into a response`.

Handlers are where your application logic lives and axum applications
are build by routing between handlers.

### Extractors

An extractor is a type that implements `FromRequest` or
`FromRequestParts`. Extractors are how you pick apart the incoming
request to get the parts your handler needs:

```rust
use axum::extract::{Path, Query, Json};
use std::collections::HashMap;

// `Path` gives you the path parameters and deserializes them.
async fn path(Path(user_id): Path<u32>) {}

// `Query` gives you the query parameters and deserializes them
async fn query(Query(params): Query<HashMap<String, String>>) {}

// `Buffer the request body and deserialize it as JSON into a
// `serde_json::Value`. `Json` supports any type that implements
// `serde::Deserialize`.
async fn json(Json(payload): Json<serde_json::Value>) {}
```
