# Axum By Example (JWT)

> ðŸ¦€ One of the best ways to understand code is to read more of it.

I would like to take a second to welcome you to this article. I hope
you're having a great day. Be safe and have fun!

[axum examples](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples)

## Let's start with JSON Web Tokens

[axum JWT example](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples/jwt)

The dependencies are going to be different on every project. So we will
start with the `Cargo.toml` to understand what will be compiled into
this project.

`Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "example-jwt"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
publish = false

[dependencies]
axum = { path = "../../axum" }
axum-extra = { path = "../../axum-extra", features = ["typed-header"] }
jsonwebtoken = "8.0"
once_cell = "1.8"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter"] }
```

* `Lazy`: is a type provided by the `once_cell` crate, from the sync
  module. It creates a static variables that initializes lazily. What
  does that mean? Well it will come into the program when it is used.
  After initialization. You can the access it from the programs data. It
  allows it to be initialized once. Even if there are concurrent
  threads.

A very simple configuration file. If you don't know about JSON Web
Tokens I recommend reading more about it.

* [JSON Web Tokens - jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)

It's one of the ways we can validate someone can access API. This isn't
the most secure method in the world but it is a highly used on. You will
want to have extra protects as well. For example, possibly keeping track
of the IP addresses being accessed from or other trigger to know that
someone malicious has access to the token.

At the very minimum if someone steals your JWT. They could use that to
log in and become you on the website. How? Well it's how we validate. If
they can validate. They become you.

There are pieces of this code that I cannot understand. So I'll have to
look a bit deeper. There are many pieces to unpack. So the only place to
start is going to be from the top.


### Importing all of the required crates

The goal of this project is to create a server that listens on routes. With these routes we plan to create two different paths. `Authorize` and `Protected`. What we can do with is exactly what it sounds like. Signing in and authorizing. Qualifying a valid identity and receiving the protected data back.

We can accomplish this with using `axum`, `jsonwebtoken`, `once_cell`, `serde`, `serde_json` and `tracing_subscriber`. I'm not sure what `once_cell` and `tracing_subscriber`. The others you will have to understand more on your own. That will be out of scope for this one.

```rust
use axum::{
  async_trait,
  extract::FromRequestParts,
  http::{request::Parts, StatusCode},
  response::{IntoResponse, Response},
  routing::{get, post},
  Json, RequestPartsExt, Router,
};
use axum_extra::{
  headers::{authorization::Bearer, Authorization},
  TypedHeader,
};
use jsonwebtoken::{decode, encode, DecodingKey, EncodingKey, Header,
Validation};
use once_cell::sync::Lazy;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use serde_json::json;
use std::fmt::Display;
use tracing_subscriber::{layer::SubscriberExt, util::SubscriberInitExt};
```

* `once_cell`: This is used to lazy load variables. It's mostly used with `Arc`
  or `Mutex` for synchronization primitives. It initializes the value on demand
  and avoids unnecessary recomputation across multi threaded environments.

* `tracing_subscriber`: Part of a larger `tracing` ecosystem. It provides a
  framework for structured, composable logging and diagnostics in Rust
  applications. It helps configure and set up tracing instrumentation in
  Rust projects. It provides various subscriber implementations, which are
  responsible for receiving tracing events and processing them in different
  ways. Printing to the console, writing to a file, or sending to a distributed
  tracing system. We can customize the logging behavior and choose which
  subscribers to use in the application.

### The main function and secrets

In this first part we are using the `Lazy` setup from `once_cell` that will do what we described above. It will create a static `KEYS` whenever it's needed across avoiding recomputations. We pull out the secret with `std::env::var("JWT_SECRET")` and we return `Keys::new(secret.as_bytes()`

We will use `#[tokio::main]` on our main function and allow it to be `async fn main()`. This will set us up for using tokio.

```rust
static KEYS: Lazy<Keys> = Lazy::new(|| {
  let secret = std::env::var("JWT_SECRET").expect("JWT_SECRET must be
  set");
  Keys::new(secret.as_bytes())
});

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
  tracing_subscriber::registry()
    .with(
      tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::try_from_default_env()
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| "example_jwt=debug".into()),
    )
    .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
    .init();

  let app = Router::new()
    .route("/protected", get(protected))
    .route("/authorize", post(authorize));

  let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3000")
    .await
    .unwrap();
  tracing::debug!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap());
  axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
}
```

* We create a new tracing registry to act as a central hub for collecting and
  managing tracings spans and events. `tracing_subscriber::registry().with().init();`
  After init the method will be initialized to capture and process tracing events.
  We will collect had route events according to the specified filters and formatters.
* Inside of the `with()` we will have
  `tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::try_from_default_env().unwrap_or_else(|_|
  "example_jwt=debug".into())` I'm not sure how to explain this part I'm
  a bit lost. So I'm going to continue and come back hopefully.
* Inside of the next `with()` we use the
  `tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer` which is another part I don't
  understand yet. I also don't know how to explain it well enough to
  explain yet.
* Create the app with our `Router::new()` to connect the
  two routes we plan to build for this `protected` and `authorize`.
* Create the listener with
  `tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:3000").await.unwrap()` we
  are starting a listener on the Tcp protocol using tokio.
* `tracing::debug!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap())`
  is just a debug to the tracing setup. I won't go to into it now.
* Start axum and connect the app together. `axum::serve(listener,
  app).await.unwrap()`. We use the listener we created and the app we
  created above. That's out main function for this program to sit and
  watch on tcp.

## Structs and Enums

#### Struct

* Claims
* AuthBody
* AuthPayload
* Keys

#### Enum

* AuthError: we create the different types of errors that we plan to
  encounter on this project.

```rust
struct Keys {
  encoding: EncodingKey,
  decoding: DecodingKey,
}

impl Keys {
  fn new(secret: &[u8]) -> Self {
    Self {
      encoding: EncodingKey::from_secret(secret),
      decoding: DecodingKey::from_secret(secret),
    }
  }
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Claims {
  sub: String,
  company: String,
  exp: usize,
}

#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
struct AuthBody {
  access_token: String,
  token_type: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
struct AuthPayload {
  client_id: String,
  client-secret: String,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enum AuthError {
  WrongCredentials,
  MissingCredential,
  TokenCreation,
  InvalidToken,
}
```

I don't have much to say about these. They are the basic data structures
in Rust. Where you can read them and it's very self explainatory. The only thing
to note is about the key implementation that we snuck in there. It' using
`EncodingKey` and `DecodingKey` types which get their value from the utilization
of a secret for encoding and decoding.

## Let create the functions for our paths

* protected
* authorize

```rust
async fn protected(claims: Claims) -> Result<String, AuthError> {
  // Send the protected data to user
  Ok(format!(
    "Welcome to the protected area :)\nYour data:\n{}",
    claims
  ))
}
```

For the protected function we take in the claims and this is a part that
confused me a tad. What is really going on here? There seem to be a lot of
information missing from this section. How does it validate?

There will be a trait that we mention a bit later that will show how to validate
who the user is. It's just not at this part. If the user is authorized then you
can get the return value of the data as `claims`.

```rust
async fn authorize(Json(payload): Json<AuthPayload>) -> Result<Json<AuthBody>, AuthError> {
  // Check if the user sent the credentials
  if payload.client_id.is_empty() || payload.client_secret.is_empty() {
    return Err(AuthError::MissingCredential);
  }
  // Here you can check the user credentials from a database
  if payload.client_id != "foo" || payload.client_secret != "bar" {
    return Err(AuthError::WrongCredentials);
  }
  let claims = Claims {
    sub: "b@b.com".to_owned(),
    company: "ACME".to_owned(),
    // Mandatory expiry time as UTC timestamp
    exp: 2000000000, // May 2033
  };
  // Create the authorization token
  let token = encode(&Header::default(), &claims, &KEYS.encoding)
    .map_err(|_| AuthError::TokenCreation)?;

  // Send the authorized token
  Ok(Json(AuthBody::new(token)))
}
```

On our `authorize` function we will take in the payload and have to make sure
that it's is the correct username and password. This does not have any database
connection. But this would be requiring the database connection and validation.
It returns a simple claims object and uses a newly created authorization token.

## What about the traits

Well this is a confusing part about this program setup. At least for me
initially. These need to be setup on the `Claims` struct.

```rust
#[async_trait]
impl<S> FromRequestParts<S> for Claims
where
  S: Send + Sync,
{
  type Rejection = AuthError;

  async fn from_request_parts(parts: &mut Parts, _state: &S) -> Result<Self, Self::Rejection> {
    // Extract the token from the authorization header
    let TypedHeader(Authorization(bearer)) = parts
      .extract::<TypedHeader<Authorization<Bearer>>>()
      .await
      .map_err(|_| AuthError::InvalidToken)?;
    // Decode the user data
    let token_data = decode::<Claims>(bearer.token(), &KEYS.decoding,    &Validation::default())
      .map_err(|_| AuthError::InvalidToken)?;

    Ok(token_data.claims)
  }
}
```

When the value comes from the request for the claims value. This is where the
validation of having the bearer token is happening. This is harder to understand
and keep up with. We create the function `from_request_parts`. That breaks apart
the `parts` as a `&mut Parts`. We then check to make sure that a correct bearer
token is there. Not that we are validating this token. We are just breaking it
down and making sure it's a JWT bearer token setup.

```rust
impl IntoResponse for AuthError {
  fn into_response(self) -> Response {
    let (status, error_message) = match self {
      AuthError::WrongCredentials => (StatusCode::UNAUTHORIZED, "Wrong credentials"),
      AuthError::MissingCredential => (StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST, "Missing credentials"),
      AuthError::TokenCreation => (StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, "Token creation error"),
      AuthError::InvalidToken => (StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST, "Invalid token"),
    };
    let body = Json(json!({
      "error": error_message,
    }));
    (status, body).into_response()
  }
}
```

We setup the `IntoResponse` for the `AuthError` that creates and sends back the
error. Nothing to special. Takes in all the possible errors and returns a
`Response` of the status and body.

## The End ðŸ§™ðŸ¦€

This is a very high level overview of the JWT example for Axum. I find it easier
to understand by looking at the example implementations. The art of other
developers that you can learn from and build off of. Have fun. See you next
time.
