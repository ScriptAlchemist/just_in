# Axum By Example (Static File Server)

> 🦀 One of the best ways to understand code is to read more of it.

I would like to take a second to welcome you to this article. I hope
you're having a great day. Be safe and have fun!

[axum examples](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples)

[Static File Server - axum examples](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples/static-file-server)

It seems that there is something wrong with this example. When I run the server
and start the project. When there is an attempt to access `localhost:3001`
nothing shows up. So we will have to work with an idea. We will just start going
through the code to understand it. That's the only way that we can figure it
out. In this example, it is going to be simplified to one route. So we can debug a smaller project before we build it back out.

> 🛑 The problem was where I was starting the program. I was starting it in
the `axum` directory. When I needed to be in the
`axum/example/static-file-server/` to allow for the relative path to be in the
correct location. It works fine. The problem was me 👀

```rust
//! Run with
//!
//! ```not_rust
//! cd axum/examples/static-file-server
//! cargo run
//! ```

use axum::{
    extract::Request, handler::HandlerWithoutStateExt, http::StatusCode, routing::get, Router,
};
use std::net::SocketAddr;
use tower::ServiceExt;
use tower_http::{
    services::{ServeDir, ServeFile},
    trace::TraceLayer,
};
use tracing_subscriber::{layer::SubscriberExt, util::SubscriberInitExt};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(
            tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::try_from_default_env()
                .unwrap_or_else(|_| "example_static_file_server=debug,tower_http=debug".into()),
        )
        .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
        .init();

    tokio::join!(
        serve(using_serve_dir(), 3001),
    );
}

fn using_serve_dir() -> Router {
    // serve the file in the "assets" directory under `/assets`
    Router::new().nest_service("/assets", ServeDir::new("assets"))
}

async fn serve(app: Router, port: u16) {
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], port));
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind(addr).await.unwrap();
    tracing::debug!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap());
    axum::serve(listener, app.layer(TraceLayer::new_for_http()))
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

## Breaking down the protect

* imports
* main function
* directory service path
* serve function

### Imports

* `axum`: extractors, handlers, statusCodes, get, and Router
* `SocketAddr` from `std::net`
* `tower`
* `tower_http`: serving directory, and serving file
* `tracing_subscriber`: Part of a larger `tracing` ecosystem. It provides a
  framework for structured, composable logging and diagnostics in Rust
  applications. It helps configure and set up tracing instrumentation in Rust
  projects. It provides various subscriber implementations, which are
  responsible for receiving tracing events and processing them in different
  ways. Printing to the console, writing to a file, or sending to a distributed
  tracing system. We can customize the logging behavior and choose which
  subscribers to use in the application.

```rust
use axum::{
    extract::Request, handler::HandlerWithoutStateExt, http::StatusCode, routing::get, Router,
};
use std::net::SocketAddr;
use tower::ServiceExt;
use tower_http::{
    services::{ServeDir, ServeFile},
    trace::TraceLayer,
};
use tracing_subscriber::{layer::SubscriberExt, util::SubscriberInitExt};
```

### Main function

* `#[tokio::main]`
* tracing setup
* `tokio::join!` the paths together
* calling out `serve` function

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    tracing_subscriber::registry()
        .with(
            tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::try_from_default_env()
                .unwrap_or_else(|_| "example_static_file_server=debug,tower_http=debug".into()),
        )
        .with(tracing_subscriber::fmt::layer())
        .init();

    tokio::join!(
        serve(using_serve_dir(), 3001),
    );
}
```

### Setting up basic serve directory

* Router pointing to the assets directory
* `Router::new().nest_service` where we connect the `/assets` directory to the
  `ServeDir::new("assets")` for a simple example.

```rust
fn using_serve_dir() -> Router {
    // serve the file in the "assets" directory under `/assets`
    Router::new().nest_service("/assets", ServeDir::new("assets"))
}
```

### Setting up our serve function

* async
* pulling out the `addr` using `SocketAddr` and the input `port`
* Print where we are listening
* Attach the layer to the server.
* `TraceLayer::new_for_http` creates a new `TraceLayer` using
  `ServerErrorAsFailures` which supports classifying regular HTTP request based
  on the status code.

```rust
async fn serve(app: Router, port: u16) {
    let addr = SocketAddr::from(([127, 0, 0, 1], port));
    let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind(addr).await.unwrap();
    tracing::debug!("listening on {}", listener.local_addr().unwrap());
    axum::serve(listener, app.layer(TraceLayer::new_for_http()))
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

### Running the server and checking it out

You must be in the directory where `/assets` lives. So the folder where you can
access `static-file-server/src/main.rs` is a good place if you're using the
example. Or just in the relative directory as the `/assets`.

We can start the program with `cargo run`. Then run some sure commands to grab
the files we have in the `/assets` directory.

#### Curl Request Examples

* curl `/assets/index.html`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3001/assets/index.html
Hi from index.html
```

* curl `/assets/script.js`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3001/assets/script.js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

---

This is a good start. There are more examples in this we will now go over. We
just wanted to focus on what makes this work at the bare minimum.

Let's add the new routes.

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // same as before we are just expanding the `tokio::join!`

    tokio::join!(
        serve(using_serve_dir(), 3001),
        serve(using_serve_dir_with_assets_fallback(), 3002),
        serve(using_serve_dir_only_from_root_via_fallback(), 3003),
        serve(using_serve_dir_with_handler_as_service(), 3004),
        serve(two_serve_dirs(), 3005),
        serve(calling_serve_dir_fron_a_handler(), 3006),
    );
}
```

## Using serve dir with assets fallback

We are going to use a fallback of this next service. If we don't choose a path
to traverse. We will go to `assets/index.html`.

* Setup the `serve_dir` with `ServeDir::new("assets")`
* Add on a `not_found_service()` with `ServerFile::new("assets/index.html")`
* Add a new route called `/foo` that returns `Hi from /foo`
* We nest the service with `/assets` and our `serve_dir`
* We add out `.fallback_service` with the `serve_dir` which will handle our not
  found case

```rust
fn using_serve_dir_with_assets_fallback() -> Router {
    // `ServeDir` allows setting a fallback if an asset is not found
    // so with this `GET /assets/doesnt-exist.jpg` will return `index.html`
    // rather than a 404
    let serve_dir = ServeDir::new("assets").not_found_service(ServeFile::new("assets/index.html"));

    Router::new()
        .route("/foo", get(|| async { "Hi from /foo" }))
        .nest_service("/assets", serve_dir.clone())
        .fallback_service(serve_dir)

}
```

#### Curl Request Examples

We will test this one as well with some curl requests.

* curl `/foo`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3002/foo
Hi from /foo
```

* curl the port `3002`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3002
Hi from index.html
```

* curl `/assets/script.js`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3002/assets/script.js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

It's a very simple design for a simple file server, but is it enough? I don't
think so. We have a few more route styles to check out.


## Using serve dir only from root via fallback

What are we changing on this path compared to the last path. We are avoiding the
`nest_service` section where we attach the `serve_dir` to the path. We only
include in in the `fallback_service`. Which still allows us to access these
files. It just does not keep the files behind the `localhost:3003/assets/script.js`
anymore. It goes to `localhost:3003/script.js`.

* The fallback is still `index.html`
* `/foo` path works
* `/script.js` works
* `/index.html` works

```rust
fn using_serve_dir_only_from_root_via_fallback() -> Router {
  // you can also serve the assets directly from the root (not nested under `/assets`)
  // by only setting a `ServeDir` as the fallback
  let serve_dir = ServeDir::new("assets").not_found_service(ServeFile::new("assets/index.html"));

  Router::new()
    .route("/foo", get(|| async { "Hi from /foo" }))
    .fallback_service(serve_dir)
}
```

#### Curl Request Examples

Let's make some curl requests to show what's actually going on.

* curl the port `3003`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3003
Hi from index.html
```

* curl `/foo`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3003/foo
Hi from /foo
```

* curl `/assets`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3003/assets/
Hi from index.html
```

* curl `/assets/script.js`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3003/assets/script.js
Hi from index.html
```

* curl `/script.js`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3003/script.js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

## Using serve dir with handler as service

* Create the `handle_404` handler
* Convert the `handle_404` into a service using `into_service()`
* Create a `serve_dir` that set's up the `assets` path
* Attach a `not_found_service()` with the converted handler `service`

The assets will work on the root path and anything not found will return the
created handler.

```rust
fn using_serve_dir_with_handler_as_service() -> Router {
  async fn handle_404() -> (StatusCode, &'static str) {
    (StatusCode::NOT_FOUND, "Not found")
  }

  // you can convert handler function to service
  let service = handle_404.into_service();

  let serve_dir = ServeDir::new("assets").not_found_service(service);

  Router::new()
    .route("/foo", get(|| async { "Hi from /foo" }))
    .fallback_service(serve_dir)
}
```

#### Curl Request Examples

* curl port `3004`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3004
Hi from index.html
```

* curl `/foo`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3004/foo
Hi from /foo
```

* curl `/assets/script.js`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3004/assets/script.js
Not found
```

* curl `/script.js`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3004/script.js
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

* curl `/assets/index.html`

```bash
❯ curl http://localhost:3004/assets/index.html
Not found
```

## Two serve dirs

* Create `serve_dir_from_assets` to point to the assets foo

```rust
fn two_serve_dirs() -> Router {
  // you can also have two `ServeDir`s nested at different paths
  let serve_dir_from_assets = ServeDir::new("assets");
  let serve_dir_from_dist = ServeDir::new("dist");

  Router::new()
    .nest_service("/assets", serve_dir_from_assets)
    .nest_service("/dist", serve_dir_from_dist)
}
```
