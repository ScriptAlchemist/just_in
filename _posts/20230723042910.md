### What is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)?

[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) or Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing is an `HTTP-header` based mechanism that allows a server to
indicate any `origins` (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a
browser should permit loading resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by
which browsers make a "preflight" request to the server hosting the cross-origin
resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request.

For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP request initiated from
scripts. For example, `XMLHttpRequest` and the `Fetch API` follow the
`same-origin policy`. This means that a web application using those APIs can
only request resources form the same origin the application was loaded from
unless the response from other origins includes the right CORS headers.

> ðŸ’¬ The scope of the post is not to teach you all about CORS. I would like to
go over a few facts about CORS. So everyone can understand what is going on with
the program we are building.

The Cross-Origin resource sharing standard works by adding new `HTTP headers`
that let servers describe which origins are permitted to read that information
from a web browser. CORS failures result in errors but for security reasons,
specifics about the error are not available in JavaScript. All the code knows is
that an error occurred. You must check the browser console for more details.

#### CORS Examples

1. Same-Origin Requests (CORS Success)

Let's say you are browsing a web page on `https://www.example.com` and this page
wants to load an image from `https://images.example.com`. Since both the web
page and the image have the same origin `https://example.com`, this is a
same-origin request, and CORS will succeed. The browser allows this because it
trusts the same origin.

2. Cross-Origin Requests (CORS Failure)

Imagine you're on a web page from `https://www.example.com` that wants to fetch
some data from `https://api.exampleapi.com`. In this case, the request is coming
from a different origin that the target API. The browser will then check if
`https://api.exampleapi.com` has explicitly allowed `https://www.example.com` to
access its resources using CORS headers.

3. Missing CORS Headers (CORS Failure)

Let's say you have a website on `https://www.mysite.com` that wants to fetch
data form an API at `https://api.exampleapi.com`. But the API server does not
include the necessary CORS headers in its responses. The lack of proper CORS
headers will cause the browser to block the request, and CORS will fail.

4. Different Ports (CORS Failure)

Suppose your web page is running on `https://www.example.com` and attempts to
fetch data from a server at `https://api.example.com:3000`. Here, the port
number 3000 is different from the standard HTTP/HTTPS ports 80/443. If the API
server doesn't explicitly allow requests from `https://www.example.com` on port
3000, CORS will fail.

5. No Credentials with Credentials Required (CORS Failure)

Some APIs may require authentication credentials (like cookies or tokens) to
grant access to their resources. If your web page tries to access such an API
without providing the necessary credentials, CORS will fail, and the browser
will block the request.

## Axum CORS Example

Let's start with the `Cargo.toml` file to see exactly what would be required for
this project. We will pull in a few crates from the `tokio` stack.

* `axum`
* `tokio`
* `tower-http`

```rust
[package]
name = "example-cors"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
publish = false

[dependencies]
axum = { path = "../../axum" }
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
tower-http = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["cors"] }
```
