# Importing and Exporting Components

The magic of components lies in their reusability: you can create
components that are composed of other components. But as you nest more
and more components, it often makes sense to start splitting them into
different files. This lets you keep your files easy to scan and reuse
components in more places.

## The root component file

In `Your First Component`, you made a `Profile` component and a
`Gallery` component that renders it:

```javascript
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

These currently live in a root component file, named `App.js` in this example. In `Create React App`, your app lives in `src/App.js`. Depending on your setup, your root component could be in another file, though. If you use a frame work with file-based routing, such as Next.js, your root component will be different for every page. 

## Exporting and importing a component

What if you want to change the landing screen in the future and put a list of science books there? Or place all the profiles somewhere else? It makes sense to move `Gallery` and `Profile` out of the root component file. This will make them more modular and reusable in other files. You can move a component in three steps:

1. Make a new JS file to put the components in.
2. Export your function component from the file (using either `default` or `named` exports).
3. Import it in the file where you'll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing `default` or `named` exports).

Here both `Profile` and `Gallery` have been moved out of `App.js` into a new file called `Gallery.js`. Now you can change `App.js` to import `Gallery` from `Gallery.js`:

```javascript
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Gallery />
  );
}

function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

Notice how this example is broken down into two components files now:

1. `Gallery.js`:
  * Defines the `Profile` component which is only used within the same file and is not exported
  * Exports the `Gallery` component as a default export.
2. `App.js`:
  * Imports `Gallery` as a default import from `Gallery.js`.
  * Exports the root `App` component as a default export

#### Default vs named exports

There are two primary ways to export values with JavaScript: default exports and named exports. So far, our examples have only used default exports. But you can use one or both of them in the same file. A file can have no more than one default export, but it can have as many named exports as you like.

How you export you component dictates how you must import it. You will get an error if you try to import a default export the same way you would a named export. 

##### Default

* `export default function Button() {}`
* `import Button from './button.js';`

##### Named

* `export function Button() {}`
* `import { Button } from './button.js';`

When you write a default import, you can put any name you want after `import`. For example, you could write `import Banana from './button.js'` instead and it would still provide you with the same default export. In contrast, with named imports, the name has to match on both sides. That's why they are called named imports!

People often use default exports if the file exports only one component, and use named exports if it exports multiple components and values. Regardless of which coding style you prefer, always give meaningful names to your component functions and the files that contain them. Components without names, like `export default () => {}`, are discouraged because they make debugging harder.

## Exporting and importing multiple components from the same file

What if you want to show just one `Profile` instead of a gallery? You can export the `Profile` component, too. But `Gallery.js` already has a default export, and you can't have two default exports. You could create a new file with a default export, or you could add a named export for `Profile`. A file can only have one default export, but it can have numerous named exports!

> To reduce the potential confusion between default and named exports,
> some teams choose to only stick to one style (default or named), or
> avoid mixing them in a single file. It's a matter of preference. Do
> what works best for you!

First, export `Profile` from `Gallery.js` using a named export (no `default` keyword):

```javascript
export function Profile() {
  // ...
}
```

Then, import `Profule` from `Gallery.js` to `App.js` using a named import (with the curly braces):

```javascript
import { Profile } from './Gallery.js';
```

Finally, render `<Profile />` from the `App` component:

```javascript
export default function App() {
  return <Profile />
}
```

Now `Gallery.js` contains two exports: a default `Gallery` export, and a named `Profile` export. `App.js` imports both of them. Try editing `<Profile />` to `<Gallery />`
and back in this example:

`App.js`:

```javascript
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import { Profile } from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Profile />
  );
}
```

`Gallery.js`:

```javascript
export function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

Now you're using a mix of default and named exports:

* `Gallery.js`:
  * Exports the `Profile` component as a named export called `Profile`.
  * Exports the `Gallert` component as a default export.
* `App.js`:
  * Imports `Profile` as a named import called `Profile` from `Gallery.js`.
  * Imports `Gallery` as a default import from `Gallery.js`.
  * Exports the root `App` component as a default export.

## Recap

On this page you learned:

* What a root component file is:
* How to import and export a component
* When and how to use default and named imports and exports
* How to export multiple components from the same file

## Try out some challenges

### Challenge 1 of 1: Split the components further

Currently, `Gallery.js` exports both `Profile` and `Gallery`, which is a bit confusing.

Move the `Profile` component to its own `Profile.js`, and then change the `App` component to render both `<Profile />` and `<Gallery />` on after another.

You may use either a default of a named export for `Profile`, but make sure that you use the corresponding import syntax in both `App.js` and `Gallery.js`! You can refer to the table from the deep dive above:

```
Default: {
  Import: 'import Button from "./button.js";'
  Export: 'export default function Button() {}'
}

Named: {
  Import: 'import { Button } from "./button.js";',
  Export: 'export function Button() {}'
}
```

#### Starting Code

`App.js`:

```
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import { Profile } from './Gallery.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Profile />
    </div>
  );
}
```

`Gallery.js`:

```
// Move me to Profile.js!
export function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

#### Solution


`App.js`:

```
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Profile />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
```

`Gallery.js`:

```
import Profile from './Profile.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

`Profile.js`:

```
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}
```

After you get it working with one kind of export, make it work with the other kind.
