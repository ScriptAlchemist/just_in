# Rendering Lists

You will often want to display multiple similar components from a
collection of data. You can use the `JavaScript array methods` to
manipulate an array of data. On this page, you'll use `filter()` and
`map()` with React to filter and transform your array for data into an
array of components.

## Rendering data from arrays

Say that you have a list of content.

```
<ul>
  <li>Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician</li>
  <li>Mario Jose Molina-Pasquel Henriquez: chemist</li>
  <li>Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist</li>
  <li>Percy Loven Julian: chemist</li>
  <li>Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicists</li>
</ul>
```

The only difference among those list items is their contents, their
data. You will often need to show several instances of the same
component using different data when building interfaces: from lists of
comments to galleries of profile images. In these situations, you can
store  that data in JavaScript objects and arrays and use methods like
`map()` and `filter()` to render lists of components from them.

Here's a short example of how to generate a list of items from an array:

1. Move the data into an array:

```
const people = [
  'Creloa Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
  'Mario Jose Molina-Pasquel Henriquez: chemist',
  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist,
  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',
  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'
];
```

2. Map the `people` members into a new array of JSX nodes, `listItems`:

```
const listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li>);
```

3. Return `listItems` from your component wrapped in a `<ul>`:

```
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

Here is the result:

```javascript
const people = [
  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
  'Mario Jose Molina-Pasquel Henriquez: chemist',
  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',
  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',
  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'
];

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map(person =>
    <li>{person}</li>
  );
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```

Notice the sandbox displays a console error:

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

Check the render method of `List`. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.
    at li
    at List
```

You'll learn how to fix this error later on this page. Before we get to that, let's add some structure to your data.

## Filtering arrays of items

This data can be structured even more.

```javascript
const people =[{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathmetician',
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mario Jose Moline-Pasquel Henriquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',
}, {
  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
  profession: 'chemist',
}, {
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist'
}];
```

Let's say you want a way to only show people whose profession is `'chemist'`. You can use JavaScript's `filter()` method to return just those people. This method takes an array of items, passes them through a "test" (a function that returns `true` or `false`), and returns a new array of only those items that passed the test (returned `true`).

You only want the items where `profession` is `'chemist'`. The "test" function for this looks like `(person) => person.profession === 'chemist'`. Here's how to put it together:

1. Create a new array of just "chemist" people, `chemists`, by calling `filter()` on the `people` filtering by `person.profession === 'chemist'`:

```javascript
const chemists = people.filter(person =>
  person.profession === 'chemist'
);
```

2. Now map over `chemists`:

```javascript
const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
  <li>
    <img
      src={getImageUrl(person)}
      alt={person.name}
    />
    <p>
      <b>{person.name}:</b>
      {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
      known for {person.accomplishment}
    </p>
  </li>
);
```

3. Lastly, return the `listItems` from your component:

```javascript
return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```

`utils.js`:

```javascript
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    's.jpg'
  );
}
```

`data.js`:

```javascript
export const people = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',
  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',
  imageId: 'mynHUSa'
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',
  accomplishment: 'electromagnetism theory',
  imageId: 'bE7W1ji'
}, {
  id: 3,
  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills',
  imageId: 'IOjWm71'
}, {
  id: 4,
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist',
  accomplishment: 'white dwarf star mass calculations',
  imageId: 'lrWQx8l'
}];
```

`App.js`:

```javascript
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function List() {
  const chemists = people.filter(person =>
    person.profession === 'chemist'
  );
  const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
    <li>
      <img
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}:</b>
        {' ' + person.profession + ' ' }
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </P>
    </li>
  );
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```

```

## Keeping list items in order with `key`

Notice that all the sandboxes above show an error in the console:

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
```

You need to give each array item a `key` -- a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array:

```javascript
<li key={person.id}>...</li>
```

> #### Note
>
> JSX elements directly inside a `map()` call always need keys!

Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if you r array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen `key` helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.

Rather than generating keys on the fly, you should include them in your data:

`data.js`:

```javascript
export const people = [{
  id: 0, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',
  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'
}, {
  id: 1, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',
  imageId: 'mynHUSa'
}, {
  id: 2, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',
  accomplishment: 'electromagnetism theory',
  imageId: 'bE7W1ji'
}, {
  id: 3, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills',
  imageId: 'IOjWm71'
}, {
  id: 4, // Used in JSX as a key
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist',
  accomplishment: 'white dwarf star mass calculations',
  imageId: 'lrWQx8l'
}];
```

`App.js`:

```javascript
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map(person =>
    <li key={person.id}>
      <img
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}</b>
          {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
          known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  );
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```

`utils.js`:

```javascript
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    's.jpg'
  );
}
```

  </Fragment>
);
```

## Where to get your `key`

Different sources of data provide different sources of keys:

* Data from database: If your data is coming from a database, you can use the database keys/IDs, which are unique by nature.
* Locally generated data: If your data is generated and persisted locally (e.g. notes in a note-taking app), use an incrementing counter, `crypto.randomUUID()` or a package like `uuid` when creating items.

## Rules of keys

* Keys must be unique among siblings. However, its okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in different arrays.
* Keys must not change or that defeats their purpose! Don't generate them while rendering.

## Why does React need keys?

Imagine that files on your desktop didn't have names. Instead, you'd refer to them by their order -- the first file, the second file, and so on. You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing. The second file would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on.

File names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the position changes due to reordering, the `key` lets React identity the item throughout its lifetime.

> ### pitfall

## Recap

On this page you learned:

* How to move data out of components and into data structure like arrays and objects.
* How to generate sets of similar components with JavaScript's `map()`.
* How to create array of filtered items with JavaScript's `filter()`.
* Why and how to set `key` on each component in a collection so React can keep track of each of them even if their position or data changes.

# Challenges

## Challenge 1 of 4: Splitting a list in two

This example shows a list of all people.

Change it to show two separate lists one after another: Chemists and Everyone Else. Like previously, you can determine whether a person is a chemist by checking if `person.profesion === 'chemist'`.

`utils.js`:

```javascript
export function getImageUrl(person) {
  return (
    'https://i.imgur.com/' +
    person.imageId +
    's.jpg'
  );
}
```

`data.js`:

```javascript
export const people = [{
  id: 0,
  name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',
  profession: 'mathematician',
  accomplishment: 'spaceflight calculations',
  imageId: 'MK3eW3A'
}, {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'discovery of Arctic ozone hole',
  imageId: 'mynHUSa'
}, {
  id: 2,
  name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',
  profession: 'physicist',
  accomplishment: 'electromagnetism theory',
  imageId: 'bE7W1ji'
}, {
  id: 3,
  name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',
  profession: 'chemist',
  accomplishment: 'pioneering cortisone drugs, steroids and birth control pills',
  imageId: 'IOjWm71'
}, {
  id: 4,
  name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',
  profession: 'astrophysicist',
  accomplishment: 'white dwarf star mass calculations',
  imageId: 'lrWQx8l'
}];
```

`App.js`:

```javascript
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function List() {
  const listItems = people.map(person =>
    <li key={person.id}>
      <img
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}:</b>
        {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>Scientists</h1>
      <ul>{listItems}</ul>
    </article>
  );
}
```

## Challenge 2 of 4: Nested Lists in one component

Make a list of recipes from this array! For each recipe in the array, display its name as an `<h2>` and list its ingredients in a `<ul>`.

`data.js`:

```javascript
export const recipes = [{
  id: 'greek-salad',
  name: 'Greek Salad',
  ingredients: ['tomatoes', 'cucumber', 'onion', 'olives', 'feta']
}, {
  id: 'hawaiian-pizza',
  name: 'Hawaiian Pizza',
  ingredients: ['pizza crust', 'pizza sauce', 'mozzarella', 'ham', 'pineapple']
}, {
  id: 'hummus',
  name: 'Hummus',
  ingredients: ['chickpeas', 'olive oil', 'garlic cloves', 'lemon', 'tahini']
}];
```

`App.js`:

```javascript
import { recipes } from './data.js';

export default function RecipeList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Recipes</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Challenge 3 of 4: Extracting a list item component

This `RecipeList` component contains two nested `map` calls. To simplify it, extract a `Recipe` component from it which will accept `id`, `name`, and `ingredients` props. Where do you place the outer `key` and why?

`data.js`:

```javascript
export const recipes = [{
  id: 'greek-salad',
  name: 'Greek Salad',
  ingredients: ['tomatoes', 'cucumber', 'onion', 'olives', 'feta']
}, {
  id: 'hawaiian-pizza',
  name: 'Hawaiian Pizza',
  ingredients: ['pizza crust', 'pizza sauce', 'mozzarella', 'ham', 'pineapple']
}, {
  id: 'hummus',
  name: 'Hummus',
  ingredients: ['chickpeas', 'olive oil', 'garlic cloves', 'lemon', 'tahini']
}];
```

`App.js`:

```javascript
import { recipes } from './data.js';

export default function RecipeList() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Recipes</h1>
      {recipes.map(recipe =>
        <div key={recipe.id}>
          <h2>{recipe.name}</h2>
          <ul>
            {recipe.ingredients.map(ingredient =>
              <li key={ingredient}>
                {ingredient}
              </li>
            )}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Challenge 4 of 4: List with a separator

This example renders a famous haiku by Katsushika Hokusai, with each line wrapped in a `<p>` tag. Your job is to insert an `<hr />` separator between each paragraph. Your resulting structure should look like this:

```
<article>
  <p>I write, erase, rewrite</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Erase again, and then</p>
  <hr />
  <p>A poppy blooms.</p>
</article>
```

A haiku only contains three lines, but your solution should work with any number of lines. Note that `<hr />` elements only appear between the `<p>` elements, not in the beginning of the end!

`App.js`:

```javascript
const poem = {
  lines: [
    'I write, erase, rewrite',
    'Erase again, and then',
    'A poppy blooms.'
  ]
};

export default function Poem() {
  return (
    <article>
      {poem.lines.map((line, index) =>
        <p key={index}>
          {line}
        </p>
      )}
    </article>
  );
}
```

(This is a rare case where index as a key is acceptable because a poem's lines will never reorder.)
