# Your First Component

Components are one of the core concepts of React. They are the
foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them
the perfect place to start you React journey!

## Components: UI building blocks

On the Web, HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its
built-in set of tags like `<h1>` and `<li>`:

```javascript
<article>
  <h1>My First Components</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>
    <li>Defining a Component</li>
    <li>Using a Component<li>
  </ol>
</article>
```

This markup represents this article `<article>`, its heading `<h1>`, and
an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list `<ol>`. Markup
like this, combined with CSS for style, and JavaScript for
interactivity, lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdown--every
piece of UI you see on the Web.

React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom "components", *reusable UI elements for you app*. The table of contents code you saw above could be turned into a `<TableOfContents />` components you could render on every page. Under the hood, it still uses the same HTML tags like `<article>`, `<h1>`, etc.

Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. For example, the documentation page you're reading is made out of React components:

```javascript
<PageLayout>
  <NavigationHeader>
    <SearchBar />
    <Link to="/docs">Docs</Link>
  </NavigationHeader>
  <Sidebar />
  <PageContent>
    <TableOfContents />
    <DocumentationText />
  </PageContent>
</PageLayout>
```

As your project grows, you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. Our table of contents above could be added to any screen with `<TableOfContents />`! You can even jump start your project with the thousands of components shared by the React open source community like `Chakra UI` and `Material UI`.

## Defining a component

Traditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites an all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: a React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle wit markup. Here's what that looks like (you can edit the example below):

```javascript
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  )
}
```

And here's how to build a component:

### Step 1: Export the component

The `export default` prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in the file so that you can later import it from other files. (More on importing in `Importing and Exporting Components`!)

### Step 2: Define the function

With `function Profile() { }` you define a JavaScript function with the name `Profile`.

### Step 3: Add markup

The component returns and `<img />` tag with `src` and `alt` attributes. `<img />` is written like HTML, but it is acutally JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called `JSX`, and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript.

Return statements can be written all on one line, as in this component:

```javascript
return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
```

But if your markup isn't all on the same line as the `return` keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses like this:

```javascript
return (
  <div>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  </div>
);
```

> #### Pitfall
>
> Without parentheses, any code on the lines after `return` will be
> ignored!

## Using a component

Now that you've defined your `Profile` component, you can nest it inside other components. For example, you can export a `Gallery` component that uses multiple `Profile` components:

```javascript
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
      <Profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

## What the browsers sees

Notice the difference in casing:

* `<section>` is lowercase, so React knows we refer to an HTML tag.
* `<Profile />` starts with a capital `p`, so React knows that we want to use our component called `Profile`.

And `Profile` contains even more HTML: `<img />`. In the end, this is what the browser sees:

```javascript
<section>
  <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
</section>
```

## Nesting and organizing components

Components are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other. If this file gets crowded, you can always move `Profile` to a separate file. You will learn how to do this shortly on the `page about imports`.

Because the `Profile` components are rendered inside `Gallery`--even several times!--we can say that `Gallery` is a parent component, rendering each `Profile` as a "child". This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, and then use it in as many places and s many times as you like.

#### components all the way down

---

Your React application begins at a "root" component. Usually, it is created automatically when you start a new project. For example, if you use `Create React App`, the root component is defined in `src/App.js`. If you use the framework `Next.js`, the root component is defined in `pages/index.js`. In these examples, you've been exporting root components.

Most React apps use components all the way down. This means that you won't only use components for reusable pieces like buttons, but also for larger pieces like sidebars, lists, and ultimately, complete pages! Components are a handy way to organize UI code and markup, even if some of them are only used once.

Frameworks like Next.js take this a step further. Instead of using an empty HTML file and letting React "take over" managing the page with JavaScript, they also generate the HTML automatically from your React components. This allows your app to show some content before the JavaScript code loads.

Still, many websites only use React to `add "sprinkles of interactivity"`. They have many root components instead of a single one of the entire page. You can use as much--or as little--React as you need.

### Recap

You've just gotten your first taste of React! Let's recap some key points.

* React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app.
* In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.
* React components are regular JavaScript functions except:
  1. Their names always begin with a capital letter.
  2. They return JSX markup.

## Challenges

#### Challenge 1 of 4 Export component

```javascript
function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/lICfvbD.jpg"
      alt="Aklilu Lemma"
    />
  );
}
```


#### Challenge 2 of 4 Fix return

```javascript
export default function Profile() {
  return
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jA8hHMpm.jpg" alt="Katsuko Saruhashi" />;
}
```

#### Challenge 3 of 4 Spot the mistake

```javascript
function profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/QIrZWGIs.jpg"
      alt="Alan L. Hart"
    />
  );
}

export default function Gallery() {
  return (
    <section>
      <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
      <profile />
      <profile />
      <profile />
    </section>
  );
}
```

#### Challenge 4 of 4 Your own component

```
Write a component from scratch. You can give it any valid name and return any markup. If you’re out of ideas, you can write a Congratulations component that shows <h1>Good job!</h1>. Don’t forget to export it!
```
