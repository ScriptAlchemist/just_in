[Tracing AKA Logging - axum examples](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum/tree/main/examples/tracing-aka-logging)

## What is Tracing AKA Logging?

Exactly what it sounds like. We are going to look into the Tracing example.
First we will look at the `Cargo.toml` to see exactly what `Tokio` tools we can
use to accomplish our task.

### `Cargo.toml`:

```rust
[package]
name = "example-tracing-aka-logging"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021'
publish = false

[dependencies]
axum = { path = "../../axum", features = ["tracing"] }
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
tower-http = { version = "0.4.0", features = ["trace"] }
tracing = "0.1"
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3", features = ["env-filter"] }
```

If you notice there are many `trace` based features added.

* [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/index.html): features tracing

Web application framework that focuses on ergonomics and modularity.

* [tokio](https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/): features full

A runtime for writing reliable network applications without compromising speed.

* [tower-http](https://docs.rs/tower-http/latest/tower_http/): features trace

`tower-http` is a library that provides HTTP-specific middleware and utilities
built on top of tower.

* [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/latest/tracing/)

Tracing is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect structured,
event-based diagnostic information.

* [tracing-subscriber](https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/latest/tracing_subscriber/): features `env-filter`

Utilities for implementing and composing `tracing` subscribers.
