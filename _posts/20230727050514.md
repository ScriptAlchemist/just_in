excerpt: "Great tutorials come up everyday. Some of them I just cannot ignore
and this is one of them. Code to the Moon released a video about creating a Chat
bot with access to a Huggingface LLM. I would like to see if it works on my
machine. Let's try!"

# Building up the Rusty Llama

> üí¨ This is from a video created and produced by Code to the Moon. I appreciate the time he put into learning these technologies and I recommend watching the video yourself. If this little guide can help you, perfect!

Before we begin let's start with a little background of what we are building and what I am using at this moment for my operation system. I'm not using a normal distribution on Linux. We are using a form of NixOS. There might be some pieces missing from this explanation like `git` or other packages that are expected to already be on your machine.

Inside of your `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` we need to add a few packages to make everything work.

* `pkg-config`
* `openssl`
* `binaryen`
* `sass`

Not 100% sure if needed but added in and don't plan to debug to see if I can take it out.

* `libiconv`
* `libgudev`

Now why do we need to have these packages? Well it's because the cargo crates that we plan to install will require them.

* `Trunk`
* `cargo-leptos`
* `cargo-generate`

```bash
‚ùØ cargo install trunk cargo-leptos cargo-generate
```

Packages included in our configuration file may download automatically on the system that you are using. Since I'm on NixOS I have to handle these. This is fine but I also needed to add a path to `openssl` because the `pkg-config` could not locate everything as needed. Using `find /nix/store -name "openssl*"` I was able to find the location that I needed to use.

The path that I found for example was something like this:

```bash
‚ùØ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/nix/store/z4vl5vjz1a479wmbm10mhdpqygg5b3vl-system-path/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
```

Why couldn't I just use:

```bash
‚ùØ /run/current-system/sw/lib/pkgconfig
```

I'm not 100% sure but it did not work that way and accurately find the path. It would keep failing. So we just have to set it to the `/nix/store` path.

At this point we should be able to download `cargo-leptos` and it should download. Now it's time to start working on the project.

## Let's start building out frontend

* Create the project and go into the project folder. Using the basic `leptos` setup and `actix`

```bash
‚ùØ cargo leptos new --git leptos-rs/start
```
