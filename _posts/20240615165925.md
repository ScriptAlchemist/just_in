# Using the shad/cn accordion in a large form

Today we are going to be thinking about ways to deep link using an
accordion from [shad/cn](https://ui.shadcn.com/). There are a few tasks
that I will be looking to accomplish.

* Accordion should exist on the page.
* The user should be able to interact with it like normal.
* The url should change to match the open state of the accordions. 
* The user should be able to copy and past the URL. Open accordions
  will stay open.

The URL should be something like `/accordion/{open}` where open can
possibly be a list of all the open accordion items. We can also use
something like `/accordion?open={open}`

### What is the choice in URL path that we would like to use and why?

we can just make a helper function that can breakdown the data with just
the comma separated list.

* `/accordion/name/place/zip/city`

This would require another file path that would take in the data. This
doesn't seem like the best idea to make the component easily moved
somewhere else. So we we need this to be build in a way that is
dependent on Next.js file paths? Or do I need it to be a bit easier to
drag and drop with a query parameter option.

This is a solution, but I'm not sure it's the solution that I will be
choosing on this one. There is a high likelihood that it will be easier
to setup with the query parameter. While also maintaining the ability to
use it on different pages (possibly?).

* `/accordion?open=name,place,zip,city`

Old school and how data has been passed around the URL for a long time.
Honestly both methods allow for data to be shared. This query method. Is
just easy to pull out and easy to put in. We can make a hook to allow
for the conversion. Move this component into it's own block of code as a
page.

---

## How can we start to think about how this can be built?

Currently we have a basic setup for a project that involves having a
shad/cn setup for components. While also having a nextjs project built.
What we have to do next. Is figure out how we are going to build a form
with a whole bunch of accordions that have to also have different state
associated with them.

We are starting this off in it's own component. That will exists on a
page. That passes down data. So we won't worry about how the url will be
parsed at this point. We will be worried about the props being passed
into the component. That have already been processed from the page
itself. Not the component itself. There is no url state there.

First we need to understand what the props could be. We want something
that can be passed in to change the Url query parameters. We will start
with a simple `changeUrlQuery`. This will be a function that is used to
take the open array and place it into the URL based on the component one
level up.

```typescript
export type DataAccordionFormProps = {
  changeUrlQuery: (newUrlCsv: string) => Promise<void>;
};
```

Now we want to extend our context state for what we want to control inside of
the component. This will include the accordion open state and the
useState set method.

```typescript
type DataAccordionFormContextValue = DataAccordionFormProps & {
  homeDetailsOpenSections: string[];
  setHomeDetailsOpenSections: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<string[]>>;
  planeDetailsOpenSections: string[];
  setPlaneDetailsOpenSections: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<string[]>>;
};
```

Now that we have a basic setup for context that we can use. Let's create
the context to use. Then also export a hook for accessing the content in
the file.


```typescript
const DataAccordionFormContext = createContext<DataAccordionFormContextValue>({} as DataAccordionFormContextValue);

export const useDataAccordionForm = () => {
  return useContext(DataAccordionFormContext);
};
```

Now that we have the context setup and typed at the most basic setup. We
will start to fill in the component that we can use elsewhere. There
will be some states being created and some handler functions to edit the
state based on a change and to change the URL query on easy set call.

> The strings need to be encoded and decoded for the URL use.

```typescript
export function DataAccordionForm(props: DataAccordionFormProps) {
  const [homeDetailsOpenSections, setHomeDetailsOpenSections] = useState([]);
  const [planeDetailsOpenSections, setPlaneDetailsOpenSections] = useState([]);

  const contextValue: DataAccordionFormContextValue = useMemo(() => {
    const handleSetHomeDetailsOpenSections = (value: string[]) => {
      const homeDetailsOpenEncoded = encodeURIComponent(value.toString());
      const planeDetailsOpenEncoded = encodeURIComponent(planeDetailsOpenSections.toString());
      props.changeUrlQuery(
        `homeDetailsOpen=${homeDetailsOpenEncoded}&planeDetailsOpen=${planeDetailsOpenEncoded}`
      );
      setHomeDetailsOpenSections(value);
    };
    const handleSetPlaneDetailsOpenSections = (value: string[]) => {
      const homeDetailsOpenEncoded = encodeURIComponent(homeDetailsOpenSections.toString());
      const planeDetailsOpenEncoded = encodeURIComponent(value.toString());
      props.changeUrlQuery(
        `homeDetailsOpen=${homeDetailsOpenEncoded}&planeDetailsOpen=${planeDetailsOpenEncoded}`
      );
      setPlaneDetailsOpenSections(value);
    };
    return {
      ...props,
      homeDetailsOpenSections,
      setHomeDetailsOpenSections: handleSetHomeDetailsOpenSections,
      planeDetailsOpenSections,
      setPlaneDetailsOpenSections: handleSetPlaneDetailsOpenSections,
    };
  }, [homeDetailsOpenSections, planeDetailsOpenSections, props]);

  return (
    <DataAccordionFormContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
      <HomeDetailsSection />
      <PlaneDetailsSection />
    </DataAccordionFormContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

### After the basic context setup

Now we are setup on the sending out a new URL when the state changes.
Now we have to figure out the way that we will take in the URL from the
first render. To allow for use to setup the form when it's open where
it's told to be based on the query params.

Let's go over some of the pieces from the code above. Since there was a
whole lot of lines that are unexplained.

The basic state of this component. We control which sections are open
from the top of the component.

```typescript
const [homeDetailsOpenSections, setHomeDetailsOpenSections] = useState([]);
const [planeDetailsOpenSections, setPlaneDetailsOpenSections] = useState([]);
```

We now are going to create the contextValue. Which are going to have a
few addition that process the arrays and send out the new query params
trigger. The props will be passed directly into this, but the set
methods will have a few extra changes.

```typescript
const contextValue: DataAccordionFormContextValue = useMemo(() => {
  const handleSetHomeDetailsOpenSections = (value: string[]) =>  {/*...*/};
  const handleSetPlaneDetailsOpenSections = (value: string[]) => {/*...*/};
  return {
    ...props,
    homeDetailsOpenSections,
    setHomeDetailsOpenSections: handleSetHomeDetailsOpenSections,
    planeDetailsOpenSections,
    setPlaneDetailsOpenSections: handleSetPlaneDetailsOpenSections,
  };
}, [homeDetailsOpenSections, planeDetailsOpenSections, props]);
```

These changes will take in a value. Then encode the value with
encodeURIComponent. If the value is updated. It will send a query string
update to the `changeUrlQuery` prop. From the main component in the app.

```typescript
const handleSetHomeDetailsOpenSections = (value: string[]) => {
  const homeDetailsOpenEncoded = encodeURIComponent(value.toString());
  const planeDetailsOpenEncoded = encodeURIComponent(planeDetailsOpenSections.toString());
  props.changeUrlQuery(
    `homeDetailsOpen=${homeDetailsOpenEncoded}&planeDetailsOpen=${planeDetailsOpenEncoded}`
  );
  setHomeDetailsOpenSections(value);
};
const handleSetPlaneDetailsOpenSections = (value: string[]) => {
  const homeDetailsOpenEncoded = encodeURIComponent(homeDetailsOpenSections.toString());
  const planeDetailsOpenEncoded = encodeURIComponent(value.toString());
  props.changeUrlQuery(
    `homeDetailsOpen=${homeDetailsOpenEncoded}&planeDetailsOpen=${planeDetailsOpenEncoded}`
  );
  setPlaneDetailsOpenSections(value);
};
```

We would have the return function like all components need. That will wrap the provider
and add the context value.

```typescript
return (
  <DataAccordionFormContext.Provider value={contextValue}>
    <HomeDetailsSection />
    <PlaneDetailsSection />
  </DataAccordionFormContext.Provider>
);
```

Now we have the basic setup for handling the array and the sending out a
URL updated based on a prop function. So this can be used on different
pages as long as there will be privilege.

---

## How do we process the data pulled down from the URL query params?

This is something that might be wrong at first. The main idea is going
to be coming up with a solution. Then optimizing the solution. Sometimes
you just have to think about all of the rendering capabilities and how
to set things up correctly. After you've already had something working.

Let's add new types to our props. That will allow for the open array
passed in from the URL query params of the page. To see if this will
allow for us to control the page on load.

```typescript
homeDetailsOpenArray?: string[];
planeDetailsOpenArray?: string[];
```

Now with this addition. We can place these arrays into the state that we
created earlier.

```typescript
const [homeDetailsOpenSections, setHomeDetailsOpenSections] =
  useState(props.homeDetailsOpenArray || []);
const [planeDetailsOpenSections, setPlaneDetailsOpenSections] =
  useState(props.planeDetailsOpenArray || []);
```

So this will add the passed in values. Into the state from the
beginning. Which will allow for the open array to be passed around.


Just a reminder the accordion that we will be using is from the shad/cn
components and it looks like:

```typescript
"use client"

import * as React from "react"
import * as AccordionPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-accordion"
import { ChevronDownIcon } from "@radix-ui/react-icons"

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

const Accordion = AccordionPrimitive.Root

const AccordionItem = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Item>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <AccordionPrimitive.Item
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("border-b", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))
AccordionItem.displayName = "AccordionItem"

const AccordionTrigger = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Trigger>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Trigger>
>(({ className, children, ...props }, ref) => (
  <AccordionPrimitive.Header className="flex">
    <AccordionPrimitive.Trigger
      ref={ref}
      className={cn(
        "flex flex-1 items-center justify-between py-4 text-sm font-medium transition-all hover:underline [&[data-state=open]>svg]:rotate-180",
        className
      )}
      {...props}
    >
      {children}
      <ChevronDownIcon className="h-4 w-4 shrink-0 text-muted-foreground transition-transform duration-200" />
    </AccordionPrimitive.Trigger>
  </AccordionPrimitive.Header>
))
AccordionTrigger.displayName = AccordionPrimitive.Trigger.displayName

const AccordionContent = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Content>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof AccordionPrimitive.Content>
>(({ className, children, ...props }, ref) => (
  <AccordionPrimitive.Content
    ref={ref}
    className="overflow-hidden text-sm data-[state=closed]:animate-accordion-up data-[state=open]:animate-accordion-down"
    {...props}
  >
    <div className={cn("pb-4 pt-0", className)}>{children}</div>
  </AccordionPrimitive.Content>
))
AccordionContent.displayName = AccordionPrimitive.Content.displayName

export { Accordion, AccordionItem, AccordionTrigger, AccordionContent }
```

So when we want to understand how the functionality that I'm building is
working out. This is the accordion that we will be playing with.

So if we create a card component that has a Accordion wrapper. We can
use the multiple type and have and array of values. Depending on the
AccordionItem value.

```typescript
<Accordion type="multiple" onValueChange={setOpenSections} value={openSections}>
  <AccordionItem value={accordionValue}>
    <AccordionTrigger className="py-0 pr-6">
      <CardHeader className="flex flex-col gap-y-3">
        <CardTitle className="flex gap-x-2">
          {title}
        </CardTitle>
        <CardDescription className="text-left">{description}</CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
    </AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent className="">{props.children}</AccordionContent>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

At the point we will just layer in other AccordionItem components. This
will still work with the open and close. An example of a child of this
component would be.

```typescript
export function AccordionItem({ title, description, children, isCompleted }: AccordionItemProps) {
  return (
    <AccordionItem value={title}>
      <AccordionTrigger className="border-border bg-surface-subtle border-y px-4 md:px-6">
        <div className="flex gap-x-2">
          <div className="">
            <h2 className="flex gap-x-2">{title}</h2>
            <p className="text-fg-muted text-left text-sm">{description}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </AccordionTrigger>
      <AccordionContent className="p-4">{children}</AccordionContent>
    </AccordionItem>
  );
}
```

With these two components. We will be able to make layers accordions.
That allow you to control the path of the url from an array of strings.
Which is a powerful function of the accordion.

## Let's use this component in the application

Let's build out the component inside of the Nextjs app.

* Create a client component because we will be using hooks that require
  it.
* Pull out the query parameters with `useSearchParams()`.
* Pull out path name from `usePathName()`.
* We will get the values out and `decodeURIComponent` to create a
  string of csv values.
* Split those csv strings on comma.
* Pull in router to change the page URL query params.
* Create a function to construct the URL path with the pathname and a
  query string.
* Router push the new string URL with query string.
* Now pass in the decoded arrays from the query params and pass down the
  changeUrlQuery function to the AccordionForm component.

```typescript
'use client';

import { usePathname, useRouter, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation';
import { AccordionForm } from '@../ui/AccordionForm/AccordionForm';

export default function Accordion() {
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const homeDetailsOpen = searchParams.get('homeDetailsOpen') || '';
  const planeDetailsOpen = searchParams.get('planeDetailsOpen') || '';
  const homeDetailsOpenArray = decodeURIComponent(homeDetailsOpen).split(',');
  const planeDetailsOpenArray = decodeURIComponent(planeDetailsOpen).split(',');
  const router = useRouter();
  const handleUrlQueryChange = (newUrlQueryString: string) => {
    const url = `${pathname}?${newUrlQueryString}`;
    router.push(url);
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-20">
      <AccordionForm
        changeUrlQuery={handleUrlQueryChange}
        homeDetailsOpenArray={homeDetailsOpenArray}
        planeDetailsOpenArray={planeDetailsOpenArray}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now our component is being pulled altogether. We separated the component
into it's own separate piece. To allow for an easy use inside of a page
that has access to the router and navigation. So all that needs to be
passed down in the data than the internal component can build.

---


## Why do we want to use the accordion?

It opens smooth and it's got a bit of animation build in from the
tailwind setup. So being able to use this and have the state stored in
the URL is something that can work.

## What about the forms?

We will not make the forms in this article. It's likely that it will
have it's own post. To go over a lot of the smaller sections that will
be brushed over quickly. Currently we just have The layered form and the
use in the page of a Nextjs app.

I hope you enjoyed the little bit of a story that I wanted to write
about some of the code problems that someone could run into. There are
other ways to make this work, but the query params was the solution that
I chose for this. You could have also done it successfully a different
way that could work just as well.

Have a good day 🧙
