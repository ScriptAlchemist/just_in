The world is changing in a way that none of us can imagine what it will
look like in a few years. Let alone when we grow old. We are reaching
the point of having collective conciousness. What I mean is, our
understanding of the world is going to be able to come from
conversation. With a likely higher rate of accuracy than from humans. A
lot of knowledge, is just copying others. Some people just pass tests in
school and knowledge is lost in a few months.

Why would kids spend time learning those things in the same way. When
they could just start to have access to these
"models/agents/conciousnesses". Which would be the, "calculator in your
pocket". Moments for the previous generation. They don't have to worry
about doing math. Cause they have a computer in their pocket. That does
the math.
