## Setting up the blog

Let's go over how you can also setup a similar blog like this. It is
still very simple and there needs to be lots more styling. That's fine
for now. The main idea is getting the ideas out.

The philosophy we should have is, always keep an open mind. My views are
my own and they can be flawed. The point isn't to disagree and argue.
It's to read, understand and build your own mental model.

### Prerequisites

* Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.
